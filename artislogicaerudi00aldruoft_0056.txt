power of the understanding in thought3 Alethioloyy, or
the doctrine of truth as opposed to e1·ror; Serrzz'otz‘e, or
the doctrine of signs and their influence to the know-
ledge of truth3 and Phenomenoloqy, or the doctrine of
false appearances and the means of avoiding them. In
his first part, he principally follows Wolf, but differs
from him in his view of the Syllogistic figures3 the
three last figures being regarded as rest-ing on inde-
pendent axioms‚ coordinate with the dictum de omni et
nullo. These axioms are distinguished as dictum de
diverso, dictum de exemplo, and dictum de reciproco. In
his second part, which treats of simple and complex
notions, and of truth and error, Lambert acknowledges
his obligations to Locke. In the third, the theory
of language and its relation to thought is treated with
considerable fuluess. The fourth part, which treats
os appearance as distinguished from reality, has more
of a metaphysical and psychological than of a logical
character, with some mixture of physiology.

Another German Logician who deserves mention, not
so much sor the importance as for the eccentricity of
his views, is Godfrey Ploucquet of Tubingen‚ a con-
temporary of Lambert’s‚ the author in 1763 of a ‘⁶ Me-
thodus calculandi in Logicis‚'’ afterwards included with
other writings in his “Commentationes Philosophicae
selectiores‚'’ published in 1781. Ploucquet's work is re-
markable as an attempt to exhibit the reasonings of Logic
in the form of an algebraical calculus, an attempt recently
carried out to a greater extent by the “ Neue Darstellung
der Logik'' of Drobisch‚ and in the logical writings of
Professors De Morgan and Boole. A severe criticism of
the principle of Ploucquet's Calculus wil] be found in
Hegel's Logic, vol. ii. p. 143. The geometrica] illus-
trations of the syllogism by Eulcr and Lambert are not
of sufficient importancc to require a separate notice.
