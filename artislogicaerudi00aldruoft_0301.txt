Secondly‚ it may be observed that the Enthymeme is
not necessarily confined to the Rhetorica] kind of matter.
A syllogism from likelihoods or signs, whatever be the
object, is an Entliymeme. In like manner, any syl-
logism in probable matter may become an instrument of
Dialectic reasoning3 whether it be based on the general
probabilities which Dialectic materially furnishes, or on
more limited assumptions drawn from special observ-
ations. The Physician‚ for example, within the field of
his own experience, may know that in nine cases out
of ten where a patient exhibits certain symptoms‚ the
disease terminates fatally. The student of history may
learn that in the majority of cases revolution leads to
anarchy, and anarchy is suppressed by despotism. Either
of these may become the basis of a reasoning process
in probable matter3 but the Syllogism or Enthymeme is
not, properly speaking, Dialectical or Rhetorical, but
Medica] or Political. And although there is nothing in
the Dialectical or Rhetorical Met-hod that prevents its
being applied to these or any other special subjects‚ yet
in proportion as any one so applies it, Aristotle regards
him as departing from the legitimate matter of Dialectic
or Rhetoric, and adopting that of some definite Art or
Sciencel. For the same reason, when he speaks of the
special application of Rhetoric to Political deliberation‚
he warns us that its object matter must not be con-
sidered as that of Rhetoric per se, but as primarily
and properly belonging to Pontias, secondarily only to
Rhetoric in one of its practica] applicationsm.
