e The term specific difference (διαφορὰ εἰδοποιός) has a different
meaning in Porphyry. It is opposed to accidental differem&
(διαφορὰ κατὰ συμβεβηκός,) and marks the differentia proper,
which distinguishes species from species, (whether subaltern
or infima‚) as opposed to accidents, which only distinguish
between individuals.

f Proprimn. In formal logic, which cannot take into
account the realist theory of essence, it becomes necessary
to change slightly the languagc which expresses thc dis-
tinction between proprium and differentia. The essence of a
concept is the sum of the attributes which it comprehends.
WVhatever does not ferm a part of the comprehensim of the
concept or of the signification of its name, is not part os but
joined το the essence: i. e. it is found in all or some of the
individuals of the class, but is not implied in the name or
notion of the class itself. Thus it is no part of the notiori of
a triangle that its angles are equa} to two right angles; and it
is no part of the notion of a body to have weight. These then
are properties, not clifferences, and, when predicated of their
respective subjects, form what Kant calls synthetiecm as dis—
tinguished from analytical judgments. Thus the non-essencial
are distinguished from the essential predicables. The further
distinction of property from accident, as necessarily or con-
tinyevztly joined, has been already noticed as extralogical.

ἕ A summum qenus can manifestly have no constitutive
differentia3 but it may have properties. There may be attri-
butes forming no portion of the universal nature (or concep-
tion) of substance, which are notwithstanding found in all
