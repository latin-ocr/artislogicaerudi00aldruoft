reasoning. It is a Dialectic Syllogism‚ if employed for
the purpose of dialectic disputation3 and, as it usually
relates to those subjects to which dialectic disputation is
practically appliedf‚ it may in general be regarded as,
potentially at least, dialecticss.

In fact, it is not as an Enthymeme, but as a Rhetorical
Sylloyz'sm, that a given specimen of reasoning is dis-
tinguished from the Dialectical. The object of the two
arts is distinct. That of Dialectic is to convince the
Intellect3 that of Rhetoric, to persuade the Will. The
same instrument may be employed by both, and it is
merely the purpose for which it is employed that con—
stitutes the distinction between themh. thether the
same means are always available for both purposes;
whether the same informality of reasoning is allowed in
Dialectic as in Rhetoric‚ must depend on the conditions by
which the disputants in the former choose to bind them-
selves. The Rhetorician has to influence an audience: if
he can effect this, he will not always be scrupulous about

s This, however, is by no means necessary. Matters not usually discussed
either by the Dialectician or Orator may equally be proved by means of
τεκμήρια. For example3 the falling of the thermometer to 320 is a siqu of
freezing; the obscuration of the moon in eclipse is a siqu that the earth’s
shadow is interposed between it and the sun. Such subjects are not
praeiit-alsy dialecticaL at least in Aristotle’s view of the art. As far as
the mere interrogatory form is concerned, it may be, and was by different
Philosophers, applied to all varieties of matter.

g This proceeds on the supposition that the Dialectician is bound to
logical accuracy in his 1·easonings; a restriction which Aristotle at least
would regaicl as salutary. See Anal. Post. i. (5. 10. We need not however
suppose that all disputants actually conformed to it.

sibi proponit. Quoniam ergo eadem omnino forma probabiliter arguendi
uterque utitur, nos hic quod utrisque commune est tractabimus, unicuique
liberum relinquentes, an Dialecticus esse velit, et uti hac forma proba-
biliter arguendi ad verum inveniendum; an Rhetor, et uti effidem forma
probabiliter arguendi ml suadendam aa! diss1mden‹lmn.”
