the sum of an infinite series.) The space to be passed before
Achilles overtakes the tortoise is equal to this sum. There-
fore it is infinite.’‘

The whole loqu-al mystery of this famous fallacy lies in
this, that tlte major premise is false. The sum of an infinite
series may be, and in this case is, finite. This premise is
equally false, whether space is or is not divisible ad infinitum.
In this way the sophism is solved by Descartes, Epist. P. I.
Ep. 118. On the inetaphysical question connected with the
matter of the sophism, see Hegel, Werlse, vol. iii. p. 218.

Coleridge‚ (Frimzd, vol. iii. p. 93.) is refuted by Herbart.

It may be observed, that Aldrich is mistaken as regards
Zeno’s object in this sophism. It was proposed to support
the leading tenet of parmenide,ss of the unity of all things, by
shewing that the identity of rest and motion 13 a necessary
result from the contrary opinion. It does not appear, however,
that Zeno advanced this argument seriously. His principal
design was to retort the ridicule which had been thrown on
the doctrine of Parmenides, by involving his opponents in
the same absurdities which they professed to find in his
theory. Cf. Plato, Parm. p. 1⁴28. Arist· δορὴ. ΕἰιηισΙι. ΙΟ. 2.

that reason contradicts the evidence of the senses. Diogenes
