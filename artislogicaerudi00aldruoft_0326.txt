thius calls it a material consequence⁸; and, in spite of the
many eminent authorities on the other side, I am still
disposed to think he is right. But let us grant for a
moment the opposite view, and allow that the proposition,
“ All G is either A or B,'' implies, as a condition of its
truth, ‘⁶ No C can be both t.'’ Thus viewed, it is in reality
a complex proposition, containing two distinct asser-
tions, each of which may be the ground of two distinct
processes of reasoning, governed by two opposite laws.
Surely it is essentia] to all clear thinking, that the two
should be separated from each other, and not confounded
under one form by assuming the Law of Excluded
Middle to be, what it is not, a complex of those of
Identity and Contradiction. Thus distinguished, the
moods of the disjunct1ve syllogism are mere verbal
variations from the categorica] form, and may easily be
brought under its lawsu.

Modus tollendo ponens.
Every C which is not A is B.

No C which is A is B.

The first is governed by the Principle of Identity, and the second by the
Principle of Contradiction.
