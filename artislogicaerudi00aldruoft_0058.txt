the phenomena of special acts of thought, it is Impossible

Logic and Psychology thus necessarily form portions
of one and the same philosophica] course, and, without
a knowledge of the latter, it is impossible to have any
sound criticisn] or accurate estimate of the former.

The writings of Kant have had immense influence on
the subsequent Logic of Germany. It is true that
the two greatest of his immediate successors, Fichte and
Schelling, have produced no direct logical work3 and
have openly expressed their low estimate of the sciencen.
But a host of able writers have notwithstanding arisen,
as numerous as the Logicians of the sixteenth and seven-
teenth centuries, to promulgate, to correct, or to oppose
the Kantian Logic. Some of these, as I-Ioffbauer and
Kiesewetter, adhere for the most part to the Kantian
limits. Others, as Krug and Fries, are mainly Kantian,
though they have materially enriched the science from
their own resources3 and the latter has especially noticed
the want of a psychological relation, as the main defect
of Kant's system. The most eminent name among the
strictly formal Logicians since Kant is Herbart3 but
both he and his disciple Drobisch have pushed to an
extreme Kant's error in an exclusively ὰ priori view of
the science.

On the other hand, the Logic of Hegel reconstructs
from the opposite side the metaphysical fabric which
Kant had overthrown. After the Kantian Critique, it

a transcendentnl system, and complains that this was not sufficiently done
by Kant. schelling in his ‘⁴ Bruno'' holds the same view. “ Welche Hoff-
nung zur Philosophia fiir don, welchor sie in der Logik sucht? Keine.''
