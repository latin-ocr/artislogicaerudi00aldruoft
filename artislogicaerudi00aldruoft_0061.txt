INTRODUCTION. lvii

PART Π. CRITIGAL.

“ THAT Logic,'' says Κο111, “ has even from the earliest
times advanced in the sure course osa science, is manifest
from the fact that since Aristotle it has taken no back-
ward step.'’ “ It is worthy of remark howeve1·‚'’ he con-
tinues, “that it has also up to this time been able to
take no step forward, and thus to all appearance seems
to be concluded and perfected.'’ This remark is true
as regards what Aristotle did3 but on the other hand, as
regards what Aristotle left undone, it is 110 less true that
the whole Subsequent history of the science exhibits
scarcely any thing but the ebb and flow of unsettled
opinion. The master left behind him a collection of
writings3 and to the substance of that collection his
disciples have, for the most part, faithfully adhered3
but he left 110 definition of the science on which 110
wrote, and no principle for determining its bonndaries3
and these accordingly have been matter of controversy
ever since.

Clitomachus compared the Logic of his day to the
moon, which never ceases waxing and waningo. The
cause of complaint has assuredly not been diminished
by the labours of subsequent expositors down to the
present time. Few logicians have in their practical
treatment materially added to or taken fron] the original
body of the system: few on the 011101 hand are theore—
tically agreed as to what it is that they are expounding.
Ask of almost any writer, ‘⁶ that is Logic ?'’ the reply
is almost unanimous, that it is the subject treated of in
Aristotle's Organon. Ask what is this subject; and
nearly every commentator has a different definition.
