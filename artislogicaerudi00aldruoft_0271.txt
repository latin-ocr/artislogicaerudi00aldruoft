are at issue, whether they are to be regarded as nominal,
or as imperfect real definitionsu. The question is of the
less importance, inasmuch as Aristotle elsewhere con-
demns the use of such definitions altogether& The
weight of authority is perhaps with the latter interpre-
tation. But, judging merely from the text of Aristotle,
the former seems far simpler and more naturaly.

From the above statement it would appear that Nominal
Definifion, according to Aristotle, is one in which there
is no evidence of the existence of objects to which the
definition is applicable. ln form it need not necessarily
differ from a Real Definition. There may be a quasi-
genus and a quasi-difference, as if we defined a centaur,
“ an animal with the upper parts of a man and the lower
parts of a horse ;’' but, until we have ascertained the
existence of creatures possessing these characteristics‚
the definition is only one of the signification of a name².

¹¹ Of the former opinion are Averroes and Zabarella, who are followed by
M. St. Hilaire in his Translation of the Organon. The latter is maintained
by the Greek Commentators, by Pacius, and in the recent Essays by
Rassow and Kiihn.

¹ See De Anima, ii. 2. 2.

Y The decision partly depends on the interpretation of a doubtful
passage, Anal. Post. ii. 8. 4. τὸ δ’ εἰ ἔστιν ὁτὲ μὲν κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς ἔχομεν,
ὁτὲ δ’ ἔχοντές τι αὐτοῦ τοῦ πράγματος. The instanees Which follow may
refer either to the one or the other.

Ζ It may be questioned whether the name Nominal Definition is sanc-
tioned by Aristotle. Trendelenburg indeed (Elementa, ξ. 55.) so renders
the λόγος ὄνοματώδης os An. Post. ii. 10. 1. and the interpretation, if correct,

would seem to shew that N ominal, as well as Beal Definitions must be -

sentences; but the context, λόγος τοῦ τί σημαίνει τὸ ὄνομα ἢ λόγος ἕτερος
ὀνοματώδης, seems rather to mean, ‘⁶ a sentence explanatory of the signifi-
cation of a name, or of another sentence having the force of a name.” On
the other interpretation, the word ἕτερος is superfluous, and the example,
οἷον τὸ τί σημαίνει τί ἐστιὶι ᾗ τρίγωνον, unintelligible. By λόγος ὄνοματώδης
is therefore meant a sentence whose signification, like that of a single noun,
is one. Such are all real Definitions, of which the example is a specimen.

a. 31. In the Greek Commentators, on the other hand, λόγος ὄνοματώδης
is clearly used for Nominal Definition. See Philop. Schol. p. 244. b. 31.
