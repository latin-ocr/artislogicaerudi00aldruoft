mits only a relative differentia. His definitior] of man
is ζῷον λογικὸν θνητόν; rational being the differentia of man
when compared with brutes, mortal, when compared with
the godsg. But if either of these attributes be selected
as the differentia of man absolutely, we must again have
recourse to Realism to justify the position. If species are
made by Nature, they may have been so framed that each
has a peculiar characteristic shared by no other. How
this can be proved to be the case is another question3
but there is no ὰ priori impossibility in the supposition.
But if the species is but a conception formed by the
mind, what is to hinder us from forming four complex
notions abe, abd, aad, beel, of which no part is a dif-
ferentia absolutely and per se, though c distinguishes
the first from the second, b the first‘ from the third, and
α the first from the fourth ?

With regard to the doctrine of the Infima Species
being the whole essence of the individuals of which it
is predicated, the case is still clear-er, inasmuch as this
language was expressly maintained by the Realists, and
expressly repudiated by the Nominalists. It is true that
it is previously to be found 111 Boethius3 but here his
authority is of little value3 as he appears in the character -
of an interpreter rather than of a critic, and does not
seem to have formed any decided opinion of his own.
In one of his commentaries on Porphyry he uses the
language of Realism, in the other, he is a professed
Conceptualisth. But even had his views been more
definite in favour of the latter hypothesis, it would only
shew that he admitted details into his system incon-
