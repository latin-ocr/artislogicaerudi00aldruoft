248 APPENDIX.

the latter3 but, when both interpretations require some
straining of Aristotle's language, it is due to the memory
of the Father of Logic to give him the benefit of that
which does not convict him of flagrant error in the
application of his own principleS.

Referring back to the Syllogism above given, the major
premise may fairly be regarded as per ωε,- the subject
forming part of the definition of the predicate. For
Equality, in the limited sense in which it is employed
in Geometry, is a property of Magnitudes3 and the
latter, as the first and proper subject, will appear in
the definitior] of Geometrical Equality. This definition
has been found by some Geometers in the eighth axiom
of Euclid3 “Magnitudes which coincide are equal3'⁷
which, stated in the Aristotelian form, would be,
“ Equality is the Coincidence of Magnitudes⁰.’'

The minor premise may also be considered as per se.
For our definition of a right angle is, that it is half the
sum of the two adjacent angles formed by one straight
line with another3 and our notion of two right angles is
that of the sum of the same two adjacent angles. As
regards the Conclusion, we need not trouble ourselves
with reducing it to the requisite conditions, inasmuch as
it is expressly said by Aristotle to comply with them.
This compliance does not directly appear in the only
form in which the proposition can be syllogistically
proved3 bnt in the equipollent statement, that the
triangle is a figure of which tho interior angles are equal
to two right angles. The predicate in this case states a
property of the triangle, in tho definition of which
property, if any be attempted, tho proper subject must
bc included.

A demonstration os this kind certainly falls short, in
sonu,- rospocts, os the scholastic model. The predicate
