RUDIMENTA. 51

morum, quae triplex est; 1. Necessariff, quando
extrema essentialiter conveniunt3 2. Contingens,
quando accidentaliter tantum; 3. Irnpossibz'lis,
quando essentialiter differunt. Unde Propositio
Indefinita pro Universali habetur in materia iin-
possibili et necessaria; pro Particulari vero, in
contingenti.

Quare, Quantitas Propositionis, quatenus ad
Syllogismum facit, est duplex: Universalis et
Particularia Et nota, quod Universalis affirmans

Opusc. xlvii. Zabarellss, de Quart. Fig. cap. 7. Some
additional remarks will be found in the Appendix, note E.

⁰ Aristotle does not recognise this account of matter as
understood in every pure proposition, but only as expressed in a
modal. (See above, p. 46.) In the latter case it is no test of
quantity, as there are universal and particular propositions of
each mode. The distinction in the text, however, seems to
have been early introduced. It is implied in the connnentary
of Ammonius on de Int. 7. (Scholia, p. 115. a. 14.) And
Petrus Hispanus defines the three kinds of matter thus:
Necessary, when the predicate is of the essenoe, or a property:
continyent, when it is an accident to the subject: impossible,
when a repugnant quality. In this point of view, the sup-
posed criterion of quantity is inapplicable to propositions in
which the predicate is an inseparable accident. But the
whole question of matter is clearly extra-logical. See Sir
W. Hamilton, Disczcssz'ons, p. 148. The Loyicicm cannot
determine a proposition to be necessary or contingent, unless
stated as such. The point must be ascertained from the Science
to which the proposition materially belongs. The Logician,
however, may use indefinites as particulars, not assigning a
quantity from the matter, but adinitting an indefinite premise
(and therefore conclusion) where the rules of the figure do not
require an universal. Hence the minor premise in fig. 1. may
be indefinite, but not the major. See An. Pr. i. 4. 9.
