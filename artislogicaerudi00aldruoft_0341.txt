APPENDIX. 257

excellence in this would only enable us to extend the
same image to a greater length, or to retain it more
steadily before the mind.

IV. The Synthet-ical Axioms are thus the ground of all
that is properly geometrica] in our fundamental assump-
ti0ns3 but the Analytical Aoez'oms are employed also, as
expressing general conceptions of equality and inequality
under which geometrical magnitudes may be brought.
Stewart was led into 1113 erroneous view of definitions by
1113 contempt for the syllogiffln, which 110 would not
allow to be under any circumstances the type of demon-
strative reasoning. In this contempt Mr. Mill does not
participate, and he has accordingly exhibited the fifth
proposition of Euclid demonstrated in syllogistic form.
In this demonstration we see both analytica] and syn-
thetica] axioms employed as major premises3 the former
as general formulae, founded 011 the conception of
equality,· the latter as the means of applying this
general conception to geometrica] 1nagnitudes‚in which
the test of equality is coincidence. One or the other will
be employed in different syllogismis, according as the
major term to be proved is equality or coincidence. The
minor premises are furnished by the conditions‚ given or
constructed‚ of the particular figure.

Against the form of the geometrica] syllogism as
exhibited by Mr. Mill the logician will have 110 ob-
jections to allege; though the metaphysician will not be
disposed to acquiesce in his statement that the axioms
of both kinds are gained by induction. And it is not
strictly accurate to represent the first three axioms of
Euclid as capable of proof by an imaginary super-
position. To the axioms in their general form this prin-
ciple 13 inapplicable3 for coincidence is not the test of
equality in general, but only of equality in superficial
magnitudes. To the axioms as employed in Geometry
