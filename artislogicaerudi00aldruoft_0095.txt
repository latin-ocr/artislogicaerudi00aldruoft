of the subtleties of the parm loyz‘calc'a, a scholastic addition to
the Organon, rather grammatica] than logical. suppositio
was defined to be “ Acceptio termini substantivi pro aliquo ;'⁷
thus the term homo, naturally applicable to men of all
generations, is, in the proposition homo cim-rit, accidentally
limited to existing individuals. In this case it was said, in
not very classical Latin, “homo supponit pro praesentibus.''
For further information on the various kinds of supposition‚

r Vooe complexa (φωνὴ συμπεπλεγμένη) in Aristotle signifies a
compound word; his example is ἐπακτροκέλης, of which each
part has a meaning in composition. Voae simplex (ἁπλῆ) where
the parts have no meaning. The later meaning of voa: complexa
properly corresponds to Aristotle's λόγος (oratio), and is not
limited, as by Aldrich, to the Proposition (oratio enunciativa).
Thus Petrus Hispanus: ‘⁶ Vocum significativarum ad placitum
alia complexa, ut oracio, alia incomplexa, ut nomen et ver-
bum. Orationum perfectarum alia indicativa, ut homo currit ;
alia imperativa, ut Patre fac immam alia optativa, ut utinam
esset bonus clericus ,· alia subjunctiva, ut si veneris ad me dabo
tibi eqmcm; alia deprecativa, ut miserere mei Deus. Harum ’
autem orationum, sola indicativa oratio dicitur esse propo-
sitio.” Sum. Log. Tract. 1. Cf. Boeth. de Syll. Cat. p. 582.
With regard to the vox decomplexa; as λόγος is defined by
Aristotle as a species of φωνή, and syllogism as a species of
λόγος, the latter may without error be called voar. But the
distinction is unnecessary; the syllogism, usfar as apprelaension
is concerned, being only three several propositions. The con-
nexion between them is not a matter of apprehension, but of

reasonin g.
