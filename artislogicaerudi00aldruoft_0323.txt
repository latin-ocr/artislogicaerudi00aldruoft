minds possessed of certain additional knowledge, be an
indication of the other3 but the true ground of the
inference is contained in this additional knowledge, and
not in the mere hypothetica] coupling of the facts by
a conjunction. This is not hypothetical reasoning,
i. e. it is not reasoning from the hypothesis, but from
other circumstances not mentioned in the hypothesis
at alln.

It thus appearS, that the only hypothetical judgment
which can be employed as the real major preinise of
a syllogism, may be expressed in the form, ‘⁶ If any A
is Β, it is O‚'’ where A, B, and C represent concepts or
general notions. The complete categorical equivalent
to this is, ‘⁴ Every A which is B is C, because it is B‚”
which admits of two intelpretations, according as B
stands for the physical cause of the fact, or for the
logical reason of our knowing it. In the latter case,
the judgment is analytical, and represents a disguised
formal consequence with B as a middle term: e. g.

¹¹ This may be made clearer by an example. The following is cited by
Fries, as an instance of a hypothetica] proposition, not reducible to cate—
gorical form. ‘⁶ If Caius is free from business, he is writing poetry.” This
may be interpreted to mean either, generally, “ whenever Caius is dis-
engaged, he writes poetry ;'’ or, specially, “ if he is now disengaged, he is
now writing poetry.'’ Under the former interpretation, it is a general
hypothesis, which may be applied as amajor premise to particular instances:
but in this case the true form of the reasoning is, “ All times when Caius
is disengaged, are times when he writes poetry3 and the present is such
a time.'’ Under the latter interpretation, it is one of the cases of a
material connection of two facts mentioned in the text. Now in this
last case, it is obvious that the inference is really made, not from the
hypothesis, but from some circumstance known to the reasoner, but not
appearing in the proposition, Any man being asked, “ Why do you infer
that Caius, being now disengaged, is writing poetry ?’' would reply,
“Because he told nie he should do so ;’' or something of the kind.
Assuredly he would never dreani of replying, ‘⁴ Because {f he is now
disengaged he is wm'tingf’ In this case then he does not reason from

the hypothesis, and the expressed propositions do not compose a syl-
logism. ·
