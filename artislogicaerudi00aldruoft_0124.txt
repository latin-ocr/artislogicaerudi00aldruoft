11, 15.) Nevertheless, on the strength of a misunderstood
passage in the De Anima, (i. 1. 16.) the threefold division of
real definition has been fathered on the Stagirite. For a
fuller account of Aristotle's doctrine, see Appendix, note C.
Before quitting this subject, it may be observed, that Logicians
have perpetually confounded the thiuy or motion within the
mind with the thingys or individuale without. Thus Abp.
Whately observeS, that Logic is concerned with nomina]
definitions only; because all that is requIsite for the purposes
of reasoning is, that a word shall not be used 111 different
senses; a real definition of any thing belongs to the seience
01· system which is employed about that thing. On the
contrary, Logic is concerned with real 01· 110110)ιαί definitions
only: its object being to produce distinctness 111 concepts, which
are the tlzz'ngys of Logic. Nolninal definitions belong to the
grammar-s or dictionaries of particular languages. Even
Kant (Loqc'lc, ξ. 106.) has not quite avoided this confusion.

of the Schoohnen were at issue. The Realists‚ following the
Arabians, divided Logic into two parts; one, which treated
of the essence of incomplex notions and things by definitimM
the other, of the truth of propositions as determined by
argmmentcction. To this latter the greater part of the Aristo-
telian Logic was regarded as belonging. The former was
supposed to have formed a lost portion of the ancient science.
The Nominalists, 011 the other hand, and more correctly, main-
tained that to investigate the essences of things belonged to
the province os Metaphysics; the Logic-ian, as such, assigning
110 actual definitione, but beri-owing 1110111 as mere examples
froin the sciencc to which they properly belong. As autho-
rities l'or the two vic-ivs, compare Albert, de Proedicab. Tract. i.
