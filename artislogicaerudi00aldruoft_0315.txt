APPENDIX. ‘2:31

And then, in consequence of the previous ayreement, but
not of the Sylloyism, it is allowed that some A is not B.
The Syllogism in form is an ordinary Qategorical in the
third figure3 the Conclusion, however, not being· the
original question, but the antecedent of a Hypothetical
Proposition, of which the question is the consequente.
The ἀπαγωγὴ εἷς τὸ ἀδύνατον is also Categorical‚ so far as
it is Syllogistic. In this, the Conclusion syllogistically
proved is a falsehood; the original question being
inferred only by Hypothesis‚ because a falsehood results
from the assumption of its contradictory ⁰. The Hypotlzesis
in this case is, that the contradictory is truce. Thus, if it

⁰ Ἐν ἅπασι ’γὰρ ὁ μὲν συλλογισμὸς ’γίνεται πρὸς τὸ μεταλαμβανόμενον, τὸ δ’
ἐξ ἀρχῆς περαίνεται δι’ ὁμολογίας ἥ τινος ἄλλης ὑποθέσεως. Anal. P1·.i.23.11.
Τὸ μεταλαμβανόμενον is explained by Alexander as applying to the conclusion
of the syllogism, because it is taken in a different manner from that in
which it was originally enunciated3 being at first part of a conditional
agreement, and afterwards a categorical conclusion. For this reason, the
syllogism is said to be κατὰ μετάληψιν. Anal. Pr. i.29. 5. ΧΥΘΓΘ it not for
this authority, it would seem simpler to interpret μετάληψις merely “ change
of question ;‘' the disputant tiu—ming from the original question to the proof
of another on which it is supposed to depend. The other ldnd of hypo-
thetical syllogisms mentioned in the same passage, those κατὰ ποιότητα,
seem to have been a kind of argument afortiori, or ab oequali, the relation
being assumed in the hypothetical premise. Thus Philoponus, in Anal.
Pr. f. ¹74, b. explains: Κατὰ ποιότητα δὲ ἐκεῖνοι λέγονται ὅσοι ἐκ τοῦ μᾶλλον
ἐπιχειροῦσιν ἢ ἐκ τοῦ ἧττον ἢ ἐκ τοῦ ὁμοίου . . .. οἷον ἐκ τοῦ μᾶλλον· εἷ
ὑγίεια μᾶλλον ἀγαθὸν ἢ ὁ πλοῦτος, οὐκ ἀγαθὸν δὲ πάντως ἡ ὑγίεια, οὐδὲ ὁ
πλοῦτος ἄρα. ἐκ δὲ τοῦ ἧττον· εἶ ἡ ὑγίεια ἧττον ἀγαθὸν δοκοῦσα εἶναι τῆς
ἀρετῆς ὅμως ἀγαθόν ἐστι, καὶ ἡ ἀρετὴ ἄρα ἀγαθόν. ἐκ δὲ τοῦ ὁμοίου κατα-
σκευάζομεν οὕτως. εἷ ὁμοίως ἦ ἰσχὺς καὶ τὸ κάλλος σώματος εἰσὶν ἀρεταὶ,
ἀγαθὸν δὲ ἡ ἰσχὺς, καὶ τὸ κάλλος ἄρα. Α similar explanation is given by
Alexander, f. 133, a. b. Cf. Prantl, vol. i. p. 390.

‘³ Anal. Pr. i. 23. 8. Πάντες ’γὰρ οἷ διὰ τοῦ ἀδυνάτου περαίνοντες τὸ μὲν
ψεῦδος συλλογίζονται, τὸ δ’ ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐξ ὑποθέσεως δεικνύουσιν ὅταν ἀδύνατόν
τι συμβαίνῃ τῆς ἀντιφάσεως τεθείσης. Ι have substituted a mere symbolical
syllogism for the instance given by Aristotle, on account of its intricacy,
and the length requisite to expand it. The reader will find it explained
by Waitz, vol. i. p. 430.

ὑπάρχον.
