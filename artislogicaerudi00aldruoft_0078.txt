the facts to the law, accepting as genuine all that
actually occurs, and rejecting every law that does
not account for the facts. The two systems are thus
opposed in their metlaods.

On account of these differences, the fundamental
conceptions of the two systems cannot be expressed
in the same ternis without ambiguity. Law in the
Aristotelian system implies a consciousness of obli-
gation, which exists whether realised or not in practice.
Law in the Baconian system means an uniform se-
quence, which exists only as it is realised in practice.
In the field of nature, the conceptions of cause and effect
imply no more than the antecedent and consequent phe-
nomenon. In the field of thought, the cause is the con-
sciously productive sels, the effectS, the thoughts which
by its own power and under its own laws it produces.
Necessity in the one case denotcs what invariably isÍ¾ in
the other, what cannot but be thought. In short, there
is hardly a term in the one which can be transferred to
the other, except by analogy. In all that is phenomenal,
the facts of the philosophy of matter can only be applied
by imperfect analogy to the philosophy of mind. In all
that is real, the facts of the philosophy of mind can only
by imperfect analogy be made use of in the philosophy
of matter. The Aristotelian Logic, like Mathematics
and Moral Philosophy, is constructed &priori from con-
ceptions3 and its principles and conclusions are pri-
marily true of the conceptions, secondarily only of actual
objects, on the supposition that they conform to the
conceived model. The type of perfect rcasoning is the
same, though there may not be such a thing as a perfect
rcasoner in the world3 just as the standard of morality
is thc same, though no man is morally perfect, and as
the demonstrations of Geometry hold good of conceived
figures, though such figures in their mathematica] exact-
