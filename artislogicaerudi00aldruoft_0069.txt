INTRODUGTION. lxv

as having been maintained by eminent authors in recent
times, and involving views which it is important to a
clear understanding of the nature and legitimate con-
tents of Logic to distinguish from each other.

According to Archbishop thately, Logic may be
defined as the Science and Art of Reasoninyt. In this
point of view, the processes of apprehension and judg-
ment are considered not in themselves as independent
acts of thought, but as subordinate to argumentation.
‘⁶ This view,” says Sir Winiam Hamilt0n¹², “ which may
be allowed in so far as it applies to the Logic contained
in the Aristotelio treatises now extant, was held by
several of the Arabian and Latin Schoolmen3 borrowed
from them by the Oxford Crakanthorpe, it was adopted
by &Vallis3 and from Wallis it passed to Dr. W'hately.
But, as applied to Logic, in its own nature, this opinion
has been long rejected, on grounds superfluously con-
clusive, by the immense majority even of the Peripatetic
dialecticians3 and not a single reason has been alleged
by Dr. VVhately to induce us to waver in our belief, that

ῑ In another passage. Archbishop Whately maintains that Logic is
entirely conversan?r about la›1yuc19e; adding, ‘⁴ Is any process of reasoning
canv take place in the mind, without any employment of language, orally
or mentally, (a metaphysical question which I shall not here discuss‚)
such a process does not come within the province of the science here
treated of.” That language in its most extended sense, i. e. some system
of signs, verbal or other, is essential not merely to the commmrication,
but to the formation of thcught‚ appears to be proved by universal expe-
rience and by the character of conceptions as distinguished from in-
tuitions. But notwithstanding this, language must be regarded only as
the secondary and accidental object of Logic, which is prirnarily conversant
about the laws of thought, not about the instrument by which it is formed
or communicated. And is any process of human thought were possible
without language, (which Archbishop Whately appears to consider as at
least conceivably true,) the laws of such a process would, equally with any
other, be matters of logical investigation. On the question os the relation
of language to thought, see Proleqomena Loyica, p. 15.
