⁸ „LHT Syllogismis etiam adnumerantur aliae argu-

mentorum species; quae nec stricte loquendo
Syllogismi sunt, nec ita tamen peccant, ut prop-
terea mereantur excludi: in quibus scilicet reticetur
argumenti pars aliqua, sed quam proclive est cogi-
tatione substituere.

which are or are not C. (Bramantip, Dimaris, Fesapo, Fresison.)
The principle is sufficiently clumsy ; the utility questionable,
since nothing can be established by this process which may
not be proved more simply in other ways. It may be
observed also, that the objection which Lainbert urges, and
with reason, against the conversion of the second and third
figures, viz. that by conversion we often substitute an un—
natural and indirect for a natural and direct predication, does
not hold as regards the fourth. For, in the first three moods
no conversion of premises is needed. By regarding the first
stated as the minor, the second as the major, we obtain a
much more natural conclusion in the first figure. Fesapo
and Fresison establish eoecepstons, and therefore, on Lambert’s
theory, should more naturally fall into the third figure. The
whole distinction, however, between natural and unnatural
predication relates to the matter, not to the form of the
thought.

⁰ propositio in mente. Aldrich had in his mind the absurd
etymology from ἐν θυμῷ, or as Versorius gives it, “ ab en quod
est in, thymos, quod est mens, et monos, quod est unum, quasi
in mente retinens unam p1·opositionem.’' The erroneousness
of this etymology (besides its intrinsic absurdity) appears
from the word ἐνθύμημα being found in the Greek language
before it assumed a technical meaning; e. g. Soph. OE. C. 292,
1199. Some Logicians attempt to distinguish between the
