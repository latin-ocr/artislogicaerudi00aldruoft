170 APPENDIX.

comprehended in a motion, we shall find all four mem-
bers admissible where the Subject of the proposition
has both comprehensim and extensi0n; i. e. is a complex
notion containing attributes, and is predicable of existing
objects. For its Predicate may either express a whole or
a part of the attributes comprehended in the Subject, or
else some attribute not so comprehended, but possessed
by the objects of which the Subject is predicable. In
the latter case, where the Subjeot and Predicate are
distinct in comprehension, they may be either equal or
unequal in extension,

The two first cases will correspond to the class of
Propositions called by Kant, Analytical Judgments‚
and by Mr. Mill, Verbal Propositions. In these the
attributes composing the Predicate are a part or the
whole of those composing the Subject. They therefore
depend solely on the Principle of Identity. If Animal
form part of the conception Man, the objectS, whether
actual or possible, thought under the latter must neces-
sarily be identical with a portion of those thought under
the former.

To avoid the introduction of new words, we may retain
the Aristotelian nomenclature of Genus and Definition to
express the relation of Predicate to Subject in these two
classes of Propositions3 though the former appellation,
for the reason stated above, is not altogether free from
objections. Under Definition may be also included a
class of Propositions which are not, in the strict sense of
the word, Analyticah‘, and are not admitted by Aristotle
to be Definitions proper3 viz. those in which the Predicate
is a single term synonymous with the Subject.

The last two cases will correspond to the Synthetical
Judgmcnts of Kant‚ and to the Real Propositions of

Ρ Though Kant admits even tautological propositious (A is A) as
explicitly analytical.
