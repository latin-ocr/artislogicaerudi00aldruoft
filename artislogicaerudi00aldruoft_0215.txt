Solutio sophismatum&

ξ. 1. CUJUSCUNQUE Syllogismi difficultas ad duas
Species revocari poterit3 alteram, quae in Argu-
mentz‘ Materia, alteram, quae in Forma consistit:
nam qui has duas expedire noverit, is in tertia, quae
ex ambarum complexione oritur, non haerebit.

a The examination of Fallacies is extralogicaL except when
the consequence is forinally invalid; in which case it may be
detected by the ordinary rules of syllogism. The following
Sophisms are not all susceptible of this solution. They are
mostly material fallacias, arising from ainbiguity of language
or falsity of assertion. But they are not treated of by Aris-totle
as belonging to the Science of Logic, but to the Art of Dia-
lectic‚ of which, as has been before observed, a considerable
portion is material. In fact, Aristotle's Treatise περὶ σοφιστικῶν
ἐλέγχων is merely an account of the pseudo-refutations prin-
cipally in use among the Sophists of his day, whether depend-
ing upon equivocal language, false assumption, or illogical
reasoning. In relation to Logic, it has little more than a
historic-al value. A strictly logical classificntion of fallacies
should commence by distinguishii‘ig, in all the three operations
of thought, between the matter which is given to, and the form
which is given by the thinking act. Acts of conception, judg-
ment, or reasoning which violate the laws of thought, and are
therefore defective in form, should be classed as logical fal-
lacies; those which are faulty in the conditions preliminary
to the act of thought should be classed as material. See
