And so M. Royer Collard, Jouffroy's Reid, vol. iii. p. 329. ‘⁶ Il
y a dans l'operation du toucher sensation et perception tout
ensemble: changement d’etat ou modification interieure‚
c'est la sensation: connaissance d'un objet exterieur, c'est la
perception.⁷’ This distinction originated with Reid : by
earlier writers Perception was used widely, as coextensive
with Consciousness in general. See Hamilton’s Reid, p. 876.
Imaqinadmz is properly the consciousness of an image in the
mind resembling an absent object of intuition. The image,

Imagination, Simple Apprehension, Οοηεερτῐοη, Notion, and
Intellection, as identical, and employed in the formation of
imaqes, ideas, concepts, or phantasms of things.

pleae apprehension is inaccurate, and depends merely on an
accident of language. In respect of thought, it is indifferent
whether we express the same notion in many words, as an
animal with che head of a man aad the body of a horse, or in one
word, as Centaur. Complexr Appi-ehension should properly
be applied only to the apprehension of the proposition, (the
