‘218 APPENnix.

A few words in conclusion on the origin of the name
Enthymeme. That its etymology is to be found in ἐν
and θυμὸς, is undeniable3 but only in the same degree as
is also true of ἐνθυμεῖσθαι, ἐνθύμιος, and other cognate terms.
But that it has no special reference to a premise in the
mind, is evident3 first, because θυμὸς in the Aristotelian
phraseology is not “ the mind,” and has nothing to do
with the expression or suppression of premises: secondly,
because the word ἐνθύμημα occurs in writers earlier than
Aristode, and before it could have assumed its technical
meaning. To ascertain the true derivation, however, is
not so eas)r as to refute a palpably absurd one. If,
however, we were compelled to make a suggestion, the
following, though not confidently put forward, has at
least the merit of not being positively ridiculous. Ac-
cording to the analogy of words of the same termination,
Such as Φιλοσόφημα, ἐπιχείρημα, σόφισμα, διο. ἐνθύμημα will
properly signify the result of an act of reflection¹¹. Hence
it is used by Sophocles for a tlzouylet suyyested by a person
or thingo, and by XenophonP, for aplan desiyned, opposed
to ἔργον, tlae execution. The term is thus naturally enough
applicable to the suyqestions or persua-§ive aryuments of
Rhetoric, as distinguished from the demonstrations of

Science.
