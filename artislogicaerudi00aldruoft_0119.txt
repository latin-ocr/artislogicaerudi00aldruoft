those of an individual. Of the former, those are inseparable, H' 15³. 7.
which, though not connected with the essence by any law of
causation, are as a matter of fact found in all the members of
the class, and can be the predicates of an universal proposition ;
e. g. “ all crows are black.⁷' The sepem-able accidents are found
in some members of the class and not in others, and therefore
can only be predicates osparticular propositions; 6. g. “some
horses are black.” This distinction between the separable
and inseparable accidents of a class has been transferred by
Archbishop Whately to distinguish between accident and
property. Of the accidents of the individual, the inseparable
can be predicated of their subject at all times; e. g. “Virgil
is a Mantuan;” the separable only at certain times5 e. g.
“ Virgil is sitting down.'' Aldrich's distinction, between
separable in thouyht and sepem-able in fact, is extralogical. Logic
is concerned only with thought, not with physica] changes.
