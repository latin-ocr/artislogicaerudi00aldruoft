1 INTRODUCTION.

of Logic, Metaphysics, Psychology, and Educational Pre-
cepts is put forth as the Art of using Reason well in our
inquiries after nuth, and the communication of it to others.
Equally vague in its conception and unsystematic in its
contents is the fragment on Logic by Jeremy Bentham.
According to his definition, Logic is “ the art which has
for its object 01· end in view, the giving, to the best
advantage, direction to the human mind, and thence to
the human frame, in its pursuit of any object or purpose
to the attainment of which it is capable of being applied.'‘
In the same spirit as Hobbes, he considers Logic from
the utilitarian point of view, as a means to the augment-
ation of happiness. But the treatise, except as regards
some severe and by no means just criticisms of San-
derson, has little in common with the Aristotelian system.
A more just and philosophical view of Logic will be
found in the works of another English writer, Dr. Kirwan,
whose “ Logic, an Essay on the elements, principles, and
different modes of Reasoning,'' was published in 1807.
Dr. Kirwan deserves honourable mention as one who
has profited by, without servilely following, the teaching
of Locke. While adopting much that is valuable in
the writings of Locke and his successors, particularly
Berkeley and Condillac, he has ably defended the
Aristotelian Logic against the depreciating criticisms of
Locke and his followers. He has however taken too
nari-ow a view of the field of Logic, in confining it to the
single process of Argumentation, in which, as well as in
his definition of it as both a Science and an Art, he has
been followed by Archbishop thate1y3 while, on the
other hand, his treatment of the argumentative process
contains much which from the formal point of view must
be condemned as extralogical.

The most important work on Logic from the School
of Leibnitz is the Philosophia Rationalis of Wolf, first
