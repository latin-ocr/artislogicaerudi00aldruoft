disobey the rules of architecture. In every art or
science, in every inquii-y speculative or practical, the
existence of the objects of inquil-y is presupposed. The
astronomer is not required to create the heavens, nor
the grammarian to supply rules of speech to the mute
fishes, nor the logician to analyse the laws of thought
where no act of thought can be attempted.

Thought is representative; its primary materials are
presentations, either of the externa] or the interna] sense.
In the product of any act of thought, it is necessary to
distinguish between the matter and the form. The
former is all that is given out of and prior to the
thinking act, the latter is all that is conveyed in and
by the act itseff‘. To conception are qiu-en attributes,
to judgment are yiven concepts3 to reasoning are yiveoz
judgments. By the act of conceiving, the attributes are
tlzouyht as representing one or more objects; by the act
of judging, the concepts are thouqht as related to one or
more common objects3 by the act of reasoning, the
judgments are tlzouylzt as necessitating another judgment
as their consequence.

The thinking process itself may also be distinguished
as material or formal. It is formal when the matter
given is sufficient for the completion of the product,
without any other addition than what is communicated
in the act of thought itself. It is material when the
data are insufficient aud the mind has consequently to
go out of the thinking act to obtain additional materials.
If, for example, having given to me the attributes A, Β, C,
Ι ean think those attributes as coexisting in an object,
without appealing to experience to discover what objects
actually possess them, this is formal conceivz'ny. If,

aus welchen Gedanken erzeugt werden konnen, und die Form des Denlfens
ist die Art und Weise, wie dieses gesehioht.”
