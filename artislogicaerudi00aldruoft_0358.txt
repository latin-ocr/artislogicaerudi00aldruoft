of liinitation by difl'erence‚ because the thing repre-
sented must be known as an actual object, and not as
the universe of all possible objects, it follows that the
indefinite ideas corresponding to the 1611115 Thing, Ex-
istence‚ Being in general, are not conceivable, as having
⁷ no distinctive characteristic. They may be elements ofthe
conceivable3 that is to say, they may become conceivable
when combined with and determined by other attributes3
but so long as they are given as isolated, and therefore
65 unconditioned, they are inconceivable. The logical
rule 11616 violated is the Law of Identity, which requires
that every object should be conceived as itself‚ and as
distinguished froin every thing else. Here the supposed
Concept contains too little. On the other hand, if the
given attributes are incompatible with each other, the
rule violated is the Lavv of Contradiction, which requires
that two contradictory attributes should not be united in
the same object. Here the supposed Concept contains
too much. The third law of thought, that of Excluded
Middle, may also be violated in relation to the same
process, if we attempt to conceive an object of which
neither of two contradictory attributes is predicable.
Here again, the supposed Concept contains too little.
But it is obvious that these three laws cannot all be
equally violated in a pretended act of Judgment or of
Reasoning. In Judgment, the concepts are already given;
and nothing 1611161115 10 be done, but to connect them
together by an affirmative or negative copula. Here
there is no 100111 for a deficiency of attributes3 which
would affcct the conceivability of the 1611115 themselves, ⁴
not the possibility of their union in a judgnient. The
onlylogical fallacy possible inust consist in uniting
notions which aro essentially distinct, or in separating
