Methodus Doctrinae duplex est. dPevjfectast’ucpoa-
ματικὴ; et Imperfecta, ἐξωτερική. Perfecta rur-
sus, vel Universalz‘s est, qua integra disciplina, vel

Particularis‚ qua aliqua disciplinae pars docetur.
Utraque duplex est.

l. Compositoria sive Syntlzeticass, quae inservit

Ι the acquisition of historical knowledge. 2. Demonstration,

applicable to sciences of pure reasoning. 3. Inductiom ap-
plicable to mixed sciences of reasoning and fact. Gf. Fries,
System der Loqik, ᾗ. 117.

‘¹ The Methodus Doctrinae is not in the same sense a process
of inference from known to unknown; for the parts are sup-
posed to be known already to the teacher, and are methodically
arranged for the benefit of the learner. This then corresponds
rather to Order than to Method in the proper sense. It may
be an arrangement either of the whole or of a portion of a
subject; and is thus either universal or particular. Cf.
Zabarella, de Mefflodis, lib. ii. cap. 20. The distinction
between the Perfect and Imperfect Method is not usually
recognised by writers on the subject. Aldrich is thinking of
the acroamatic and exoteric teaching of Aristotle and others ;
the characteristic feature of the latter being the suppression
of certain doctrines as not fitted for a promiscuous audience.
Whereas the universal and particular Methods merely relate
to the whole and the parts in the same exposition.

e On Synthesis and Analysis‚ and the various employment
of both, some remarks will be found in the Appendix, note G.
The notion of Synthesis in the present passage corresponds
to that of Metaphysical parts and whole, which is there nien-
tioned as applicable to a syllogistic process from a general
principle to its particular application. Not so that of Analysis;
which in the present passage is also a process from the universal
to the particular, not from the particular to the universal.
By Subjectum is meant the most general Subject whose pro-
perties the Science investigates; as Magnitude in Geometry.
