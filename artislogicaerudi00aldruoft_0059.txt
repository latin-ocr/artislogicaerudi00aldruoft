was impossible to bring a philosophy of the Absolute
within the received compass of human thought: there
remained only the attempt to expand thought to the
immensity of the object, by a gigantic scheme of Intel-
lectual Panffleism, in which the personal consciousness
and its limits should be absorbed in the processes of the
one Infinite Mind. Such is the fundamental principle
of the Logic of Hegel, a Logic constructed‚ not in obe-
dience to, but in defiance of, the laws of thought, which
are held to be valid only for the finite understanding
dealing with finite objects; the philosophy of the infinite
being based on their abrogation.

It is not easy to give in a short compass an account of
Hegel's Logic, which shall be intelligible to an English
reader. If we were to describe it as an attempt to
develope a Philosophy of Being in general, by repro-
ducing the Divine Thought in the act of Creaffion, we
might support the view by sufficient quotations from the
work3 but it would convey an erroneous impression to
one who did not bear in mind the total suppression of
personality, divine as well as human, in the Hegelian
philosophy. It may perhaps be better characterized as
an illegitimate expansion of the fundamental principle
of the Cartesian philosophy, modified in some degree by
the Kantian. “ Cogito, ergo sum'' is true within the
limits of the personal consciousness. I exist only in so far
as Ι am conscious of my existence3 and I am conscious
only as being affected in this or that determinate manner.
Within these limits Thought and Being are identical, and
every modification of the one is a modification of the other.
But if the same principle is to be accepted in its Hegelian
extent, I must commence by asoending from my per-
sonal consciousness to a supposed Universal Thought‚
identical with Being in general. Here personality dis-
appears altogether3 and the problem is, to deduce from
