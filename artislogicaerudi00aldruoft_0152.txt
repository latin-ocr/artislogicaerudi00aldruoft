68 ARTIS LoelcAE

alicujus tertii3 idque propter Canones sequentesh,
in quibus vis omnis Syllogistica fundatur.

1. Quae conveniunt in uno aliquo eodemque
tertio, ea conveniunt inter se.

¹¹ These Oanons are an attempt to reduce all the three
figures of syllogism directly to a single principle; the dictam
de omni et nullo of Aristotle‚ which was universally adopted
by the scholastic Logieians‚ being (1116611)- applicable to the
first figure only. This reduction‚ so long as the predicate
of propositions has no expressed quantity, is illegitimate;
the terms not being equaL but contained one within another,
as is denoted by the names major and minor. Hence, as
applied to the first figure, the word conveniunt has to expreSS‚
at one and the same time, the relation of a greater to a 1655,
and of a less to a greater,-of a predicate to a subject, and of
a subject to a predicate. In the system of Sir W. Hamilton,
by assigning a quantity to the predicate, the ternis of every
proposition are equal in extent; and the Canons become
legitimate representatives of the syllogism; but in this case
they are only narrower statements of the true syllogistie laws;
which are given in the Principles of Identity and Contra-
diction. (Every A is A; No A is not A.) These, with the
Principle of Excluded Middle, (Every thing is either A or
not A‚› are the highest and most exact statements of the
Necessary Laws of Thought. of. Prozeyomena Loqica„ p. 223.
(2nd ed. p. 240.)

Wallis mentions the Oanons as recent innovatione in Logic.
“Nonnulli autem Logici, (nostri seculi aut superioris) post-
habita veterum probatione per Dictum de Onmz‘ et de Nullo,
aliud substituunt 1111115 loco Postulatumg nimirum, chce con-
veniunt in eodem tertio conveniunt inter se. Insc. Loy. l. iii. c. 5.
Cf. Bacon. Nov. Orgy. l. ii. aph. 27. Melanchthon (Erocemata‚
p. 172, ed. 1568.) mentions thom as adopted by a sect of
Logicians in his day. The earliest writer in whom I have
found thom is Rodolphus Agricola, De Iuv. Dial. i. 2. He
describes at considerable length the office of the middle term
as 11 measure of equality or inequality.
