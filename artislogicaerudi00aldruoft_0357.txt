As regards Formal or Logical Fallacies‚ a fuller ex-
planation may be needed. The ultimate test of the
logical validity of any thought is conceivability. This
test may be applied to judgments and reasonings, as
well as to concepts. A concept is logically real if it is
conceivable3 that is to say, if its constituent parts can be
combined with each other in an unity of representation.
If it oomplies with this criterion, it is real as a thought:
whether its supposed object be real as a thing, is a
question with which Logic has no concern. A judgment,
again, is logically true or necessary, (for Logic recognises
no truth short of necessity,) if its contradictory is incon-
ceivable: it is logically false or impossible, if it is itself
inconceivable3 but if two contradictory assertions are
both equally conceivable, it does not lie within the pro-
vince of Logic to¹ determine their truth or falsehood. A
reasoning, in like manner, is logically necessary, if the
contradictory of the conclusion cannot be conceived as
true, consistently with the assumed truth of the premises:
it is logically impossible, if the conclusion itself cannot
be so conceived. If, however, the conclusion and its
contradictory are equally conceivable along with the
assumed truth of the premises, the conclusion may or
may not have a material value, bnt it is one which cannot
be recognised by Logic.

But though the test of conceivability is thus applicable
to judgments and reasoningS, as well as to concepts, it is
applicable in a different manner. A given combination
of attributes may be inconceivable, either because it
contains too little, or because it contains too much.
That is to say, it may either be defective in the con-
ditions under which alone attributes can be united in
representation, or it may contain such attributes as
mutually exclude one another. Thus, inasmuch as unity
of representation is only' possible under the condition
