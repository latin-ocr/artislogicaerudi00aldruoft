P Physical definition is rejected by Aristode, (Metaph. vi.
11.) on the ground that the physical parts are not parts of the
species, but of the individuals. Aldrieh's expression, ⁴‘ partes
essentioe physicas,'’ cannot be tolerated, unless we regard univer-
sal notions as not merely real substanees, but eorporeal. In
the example given by Aldrieh, the so-called Physical definition
may be regarded as merely an indirect mode of expressing
the same notion that the Metaphysieal definition expresses
direotly. It is thus merely an accident-al variation of lan-
guage, easily reduced to the direct form, and is so regarded
by Albert, de Praed. Traet. i. chap. 6. and by Occam, pt. i.
611. 26. In all other cases it is no definition at all.

‘1 Most Logicians reekon two principal methods of nominal
definition: 1. by a synonymous term, e. g. “ensis est gladius :'‘
2. by Etymology‚ as in Aldrieh's example. The former is in
fact translation, it being indifferent whether the synonyms
belong to the same language or not; the latter will in many
cases be no definition at all; a large number of words having
quite lost their etymological meaning. Neither of these
methods is countenanced by Aristotle; see Appendix‚ note C.
The former may be traeed to the Greek Commentators; see
Alexander, in Metaph. p. 442. ed. Bonitz. The latter is an
innovation borrowed from the Rhetorioians, by whom it was
called Notan‘o. See Cicero, Top. 611. 8.

“In Mathematffls, and in all strict Scienees‚'’ says Abp.
Whately‚ “the Nominal and the Real Definition exaetly 60111-
cide3 the meaning] of the word, and the nature of the tlzz'nfs,
being exactly the same.'' This remark is based on Loeke;
(Essay, b. iii. 6. 3. §.18.) but it oonfounds the Real Essence
of Loeke, i. e. 1116 unknown constitution of each individual
with the Loqical Esseozce or eontents of a qeneral motion. Cf.
