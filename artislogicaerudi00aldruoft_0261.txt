These objections wil] stand or fall, according as their
authors have rightly or wrongly divined the purpose of
Aristotle’s classification. Kant is mistaken in supposing
that Aristotle added the post-predicaments to complete
his list of Categories. The post-predicaments were not
so called by Aristotle, and have never been classed by
commentators among the Categories. The term is of
scholastic origin, and was employed to denote the five
subjects treated of by Aristotle after the Categories
proper. Kant is equally mistaken in supposing that
Aristotle had any intention of classifying the pure forms
of the understanding, independent of experience. On
the contrary, the Categories belong to the matter of
thought, are generalized from experience, and leave
altogether untouched the psychological question of the
existence of elements ὰ priorid. Any objection, there-
fore, based on the inclusion of empirica] or the ex-
clusion of original elementS, is untenable, and rests on
a misapprehension of the philosopher's design. Nor yet
can we adopt Mr. Mill's opinion, that Aristotle designed
a classification os all things capable of being named, at
least not in that point of view in which things are
regarded according to their real characteristics as pre—
sented to consciousness. The Categories are rather an
enumeration of the different modes of naming things,
classified primarily according to the grammatica] dis-
tinctions of speech, and gained, not from the observation
