RUDIMENTA. 49

homo est doctus. Indefinitcffi, quae (terminum com-
munem sine signo, et proinde) ancipitem: nam
manente formula, vim recipit diversam3 ut, Homo
est animal, nempe omnis: Homo est doctus, aliquis
scilicet.

Petitur haec Divisio a chantz‘tate Propositionis:
nempe numero eorum pro quibus subjectum sup-
ponit: unde et per has species bene respondetur
interroganti, Quanta sit propositio? Hanc doc-

xlviii. de Int. cap. 7. Of these, the two first will clearly form
singular propositions. With regard to the last, it has been
doubted whether they properly form singulars or particulars.
Vives maintains them to be singulars; obseiwing, that quidam
is not more indefinite than Socrates to one who is not ac-
quainted with the man. But there is this difference. Is
we say, ‘⁴ quidam concionatur? “quidam legit,'' there is no
evidence that the same person is spoken of in the two pro-
positions ; while Socrates, except by a mere quibble‚ will always
designate the same person. There may indeed be two persons
of the same name; but in this case the name fails to accon]⁴
plish the intended distinction, and we must specify Socrates
the son os SophroniSCUS. Hence aliquis and quidam are pro-
perly called particulars. Cf. Wallis, Logic, lib. 2. cap. 4.

¹ ‘⁴ The term indefinite ought to be discarded in this relation,
and replaced by indesiynate.” Hamilton on Reid, p. 692.
This proposition has no claim to a place in Logic‚ being only
the negation of any logical quantity at all. The true in-
definite proposition is in fact the particulam the statement
“some A is B“ being applicable to an uncertain number of
instances, from the whole class down to any portion of it.
For this reason particular propositione, were called indefinites
by Theophrastus. See Ammonius in de [nt. f. 63 a. ed.
1546. Alexander in Anat. Pr. f. 26 b. Cf. Prantl, Gesch. der
Loquc, I. p. 356.
