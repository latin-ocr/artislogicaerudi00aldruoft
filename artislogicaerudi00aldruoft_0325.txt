APPENDIX. ‘241

Syllogism is supposed to proceed either from the affirm-
ation of one member to the denial of the rest, or from
the denia] of all but one to the affirmation of that one,
by the Principle of Excluded Middleq.

This can scarcely be regarded as a correct analysis of
the process, unless the two members are for-mally stated
as contradictory. The Principle of Excluded Middle
asserts that every thing is either A or not A, that of two
contradictories, one must exist in every subject3 as the
Principle of Contradiction asserts that they cannot both
exist. But if the two members are not stated as contra-
dictories, if my disjunctive premise is, ‘⁶ All G is either A
or B‚” Ι make the material assertion that All C which is
not A is Β. If then I reason, “ This G is not Af, there-
fore it is B‚” Ι employ the Principle of Identity in addi-
tion to that of Excluded Middle. Again, if Ι maintain
that No C can be both A and B, Ι make the materIaI
assertion that No O which is A is B; and from hence 10
reason, “ This C is A, therefore it is not B,’‘ requires not
the Principle of Excluded Middle, but that of Contra-
diction. In the first case, the Excluded Middle does
not lead directly to the conclusion, bnt only to the con-
traposition of the minor premise. When we deny this
C to be A, this principle enables us to assert that it is
not-A, and hence to bring the reasoning under the Prin-
ciple of Identity. But in the second case, in which one
of the opposed members is affirmed, the ground on which
we deny the other, is not because both cannot be false,
but because both cannot be true.

It may be questioned whether this second inference is
warranted by the form of the disjunctive premise. Boe-

f The indefinite minor, “ but ri! is not A,‘’ is as objectionable in this
syllogism as in the conditional.
