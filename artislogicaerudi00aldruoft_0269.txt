expressed3 but it seems probable that he regarded the
formal cause only as available for the purpose of De-
finition. For a material cause, properly speaking, has
no place in attributes, but only in physical substances¹3
and that which in the former is most nearly analogous
to matter, viz. the necessary condition out of which the
effect arises‚ may in such cases be identified with the
formal cause. This Aristotle allows in the chapter in
question, when he states that the material cause there
instanced as a middle term is in fact the same as the
formalm. The efficient and final causes seem to be
excluded, as not being contemporaneous with their
effects, so that from the existence of the one we cannot
certainly infer that of the othern. thereas the formal
cause is expressly distinguished as τὸ τί ἧν εἷναιο; and
the examples given of it in Anal. Post. ii. 1⁴2. 1. corre-
spond exactly to those previously given as Definitions.
The other causes only accidentally serve the same pur-
pose, in those instances in which they coincide with the
formalP.

οὕτω μετιέναι, εἴ τις μέτεισιν ὀρθῶς, εἴπερ ἄρα αἴτιά τε ταῦτα καὶ τοσαῦτα, καὶ
δεῖ τὰ αἴτια γνωρίζειν. Ἐπὶ δὲ τῶν φυσικῶν μὲν αἷδίων δὲ οὐσιῶν ἄλλος λόγος.
Ἴσως ’γὰρ ἔνια οὐκ ἔχει ὅλην, ἢ οὐ τοιαύτην ἀλλὰ μόνον κατὰ τόπον κινητήν.
Οὐδ’ ὅσα δὴ Φύσει μὲν μή, οὐσίᾳ δέ, [sc. ὑπάρχει] οὐκ ἔστι τούτοις
ὕλη ἀλλὰ τὸ ὑποκείμενον ἡ οὐσία. Οῖον τί αἴτιον ἐκλείψεως, τίς

Α very different view has been taken by some Logicians. Crakanthorpe,

sor example, maintains that Demonstration can only be, “ a causa efficiente ,

per emanationem,vel a causa efficiente per externam actionem, vel a causa
finali ;” and he devotes a chapter to shewing that neither the Material
nor the Formal cause can be a middle term in Demonstration, though
the efficient cause of the Attribute may be the formal cause os the
subject. A similar view is maintained by Sanderson, lib. iii. cap. 15.
