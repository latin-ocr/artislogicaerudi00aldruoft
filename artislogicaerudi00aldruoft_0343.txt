two perfect straight lines, those lines cannot· enclose
a space, andis there exists any where a figure formed by
three such lines, it has its angles equa] to two right
angles, But this supposed existence of the objects
cannot be verified by any process of mathematical
reasoning. To bridge over the chasm which separates
thoughts from things, to determine how sar a subjective
necessity of thinking indicates a corresponding objective
necessity of existence, is the office, not of Mathematics,
but of a Science of Being, of Metaphysics, or, as Plato
would say, of Dialectic.

But though objective existence is beyond the province
of the mathematician, there is a further condition of
subjective existence, which he is bound to verify for
himself, by an appeal to pure intuz'tz'0n; i. e. by con-
structing in his mind an image corresponding to each
assumed conception. As far as mere nomenclature is
concerned, we might employ the term bianyle to denote
a rectilinear figure of two sides, or the term bicentrical
circle to denote a figure in which all straight lines drawn
from two interior points to the circumference are equal
to each other. There is no logical contradiction in
such definitions; and those who maintain that all
mathematica] certainty depends on experience, are
bound in consistency to admit that these conceptions
are no more absurd than those of a centaur or a hippo-
g1·yph; representing objects no otherwise inconceivable
than that experience has shewn them to have no real
existence.

Hence it follows, that no expression in Geometry
which combines together a plurality of attributes can be
regarded as a pure definition. For the assumption that
such attributes can coexist in an image or figure is either
demonstrable or indemonstrable. In the former case
the definition is coupled‘with a theorem, in the latter
