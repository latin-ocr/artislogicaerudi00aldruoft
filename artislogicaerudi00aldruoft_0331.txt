APPENDIX. 247

“ Magnitudes equal to the adjacent exterior and interior
angles of a triangle are equal to each other;

The three interior angles and two right angles are equal to
the adjacent exterior ancl interior angles ;

Therefore, they are equal to each other.''

The major premise of this Syllogism is an immediate
deductiori from the first axiom 3 thus:

“ Magnitudes which are equal to the same are equal to
each other;

Magnitudes equal to the adjacent exterior and interior
angles are equal to the sa1ne;

Therefore‚ they are equal to each othei-13²

That the true syllogistic analysis of Geometrical Demon-
strations will always be in this form, the axioms standing
as major pmmises, and the constructions in each ease
furnishing the proper minor, is evident. It only remains
to see whether the text of Aristotle can be aceommodated
to this interpretation as well as to the other.

With some passages it evidently tallies much better.
The places in which the axioms are mentioned in
connexion with demonstration have never been satis-
factorily explained on the scholastie interpretation ¹¹¹.
There are others which prima facie appear to favour

¹²¹ The difficulty is evaded rather than surmounted by distinguishing
immediate propositions from axioms, and saying that the latter are employed
in demonstrationi virtually but not actually. Aquinas, Opuso 48. de Syll.
Dem. cap. 63 Cf. Zabarella„ in Ι. An. Post. Cont. 57, 58, Crakanthorpe,
Log. lib, iv. cap. 1. For, in the first place, Aristotle expressly calls the
axioms immediate principles of syllogism‚ and principles from which we
demonstrate. In the second place, any principle which virtually enters and
confirms the premises of a demonstration must, if the syllogistic theory be
worth any thing, be capable of syllogistic connexion with the premises
which it eonfirms: and until this connexion is formally exhibited, no
[lemonstration can be logieally complete.
