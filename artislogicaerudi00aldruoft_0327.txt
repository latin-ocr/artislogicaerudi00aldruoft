ON THE DEMONSTRATIVE SYLLOGlsM.

SCIENTIFIC knowledge (τὸ ἐπίστασθαι), except when of
axiomatic p1·inoiplesa‚ requires a conviction of the neces—
sity of the proposition known, and a knowledge of its
causeb. This is produced by the Demonstrative or
Scientific Syllogism, which, according to Aristotle’s
definiffion, is ἐξ ἀληθῶν καὶ πρώτων καὶ ἀμέσων καὶ γνωριμω-
τέρων καὶ προτέρων καὶ αἰτίων τοῦ συμπεράσματοςο, Α3 the
conclusions of this Syllogism are necessary, so must
also be the premises3 this necessity consists in their
being per se, in either the first or the second sense of
that expressiond. If any of these conditions are not
complied with, e. g. if the premise, though containing

ὃ In the strict sense os the ternas, ἐπίστασθαι 13 said of necessary truths
which we receive by deduction from higher truths ; νοεῖν, of those which we
receive as evident of themselves. Hence the principal meanings of the
corresponding ternas, ἐπιστήμη and νοῦς. The latter, however, or rather its
result, is sometimes called ἐπιστήμη ἀναπόδεικτος. Cf. Anal. Post. i. 3. 2, 3.
i. 33. 1. ii. 19. 7. Eth. Nic. vi. 9. 9, The word ὅροι, 111 the first and last of
these places, does not mean, as Pacius explains, simple ten-ms, but, as
M. St. Hilaire renders, “les propositions immffliatesJ' i. e. axioms—the
limits from which Demonstration commences.

thing3 i. e. not demonstrable by a middle term from any higher truth3
γνωριμώτερα. SC. φύσει, not ἡμῖν, i. e. more universal.

d Of necessity, three degrees are enumerated, Anal. Post. i. 4. Κατὰ
παντός, καθ’ αὑτό, and. ᾗ aim-6,- usually rendered, cle omni, per se, and
quatenus ipsum. Of per se, as applied to a proposition, four senses are
given. l. When the predicate is part of the definition of the subject.
2. When the subject is part of the definiti‘on of the predicate. 3. When
existence is predicated of a substance. 4. When the subject is the external
efficient cause of the predicate. Propositions in Demonstration proper
must be per se either in the first or second meaning. See Anal. Post. i„
6. l. ”
