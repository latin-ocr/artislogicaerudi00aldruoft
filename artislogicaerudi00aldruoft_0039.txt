INTRODUCTION. XXXV

expressly on the science3 and the scholastic contri-
butions to the matter of Logic should be confined to
such additions to the Aristotelian text as have been
incorporated into the Loyica docens. In this respect
the Schoolmen did much to fix the technical terms of
the science, particularly iu respect of the relation of
thought to language. Most of the distinctions of the
different uses and significations of words are due to
them 3—distinctio'ns, however, carried to an useless and
wearisoine minuteness in the grammatica] subtleties of
the parva Zoyicalzfa. They also contributed considerably
to that which is most wanting in Aristotle, an exact
conception of the nature and office of Logic3 though
their definitions were not always consistent with the
rest of their treatment3 the text of Aristotle being
seldom modified to suit the theory of the science. But
the most remarkable contribution of this period is to
be found in that singular system of logical mnemonics
by which, from the time of Petrus Hispanus, nearly all
the forms and processes of Logic might be learned by
rote and performed almost mechanically, by the aid of
a memorial word or line. The controversy between the
Realists and the Nominalists, though introduced into
the pages of professedly logical treatises, cannot be
regarded as an accession to the science. Its real
bearings on the text of Aristotle and Porphyry were
not seen by the disputants on either side⁸3 and the
controversy, as conducted by them, must be regarded as
a metaphysical excrescence, introduced out of its place
in a logical system.

The earliest scholastic writings on Logic proper are Abelard.
those of Abelard, the greater part of which have recently
been published for the first time in the volume edited by
M. Oousin. This volume contains, besides a theological
