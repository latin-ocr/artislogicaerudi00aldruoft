with an axiom. Thus, for example, to define a triangle
as a rectilinear figure of three sides involves the as-
sumption that three straight lines can enclose a space,
which is quite as much an axiom as the assumption
that two cannot. Again‚ to desine an acute angled
triangle as one that has three acute angles involves the
assumption that three straight lines inclined at acute
angles to each other will enclose a space. Accordingly
we find in the ordinary editions of Euclid many of the
definitions accompanied by figures, which furnish an
evidence of the possibility of the conception by a direct
appeal to the intuition. So also the definition, that “a
circle is a figure contained by one line which is called

the circumference, and is such that all straight lines
drawn from a certain point within the figure to the

7

circumference are equal to one another-,³ involves the
assumption that a line so drawn as to be always equally
distant from a given point will return into itself 01· be
one line including a space ;·—an assumption which
might be more properly classed as an axiom than as a
definition ¹¹.

From this we may conclude that the numerous attempts
of Geometers to diminish or get rid of their axioms have
been steps in a wrong direction⁵. The number of
axioms‚ instead of being diminished‚ should be very
considerably increased 3 and the errors that have hitherto
prevailed 011 1116 nature and foundation of Geometrical
reasoning have been mainly owing to the manner in
which many indispensable assumpt-iens have been either

omitted altogether, or concealed among the definitions.
