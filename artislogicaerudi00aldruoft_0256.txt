be indicated in the symbolica] form of the proposition.
If, on the other hand, a special form of the copula is
adopted, and Property and Accident distinguished by the
expressions A must be B, A may be Β, the classification
becomes no longer applicable to the pure form of the
proposition, and requires the introduction of the extra-
]ogical doctrine of Modality‘l. The adoption of a
quantified predicate, on the other hand, is a necessary
step when language is designed to express the pure form
of thought, and every classification of logical forms
should be adapted to this condition r.

[n the foregoing remarks, Genus and Definition ex-
press a relation of notions to notions, Property and
Accident, one of attributes to things. Hence it will follow
that notions thought as unrea],i. e. confessedly predicable
of no objects existing elsewhere than in the mind, can
only, as such, be the subjects of analytical judgments.
Proper names, on the other hand, having no essence, can
only be the subjects of synthetical judgments. The
former have no Proper-ties or Accidents3 the latter have
no Genus or Definition.

Species is excluded from the Predicables‚ and confined
to the Species Subjicibilz‘s, the correlative of the Predicable
Genus. By this we avoid an inconsistency of which the
majority of Logicians are guilty, in employing the term
Species sometimes to express a relation of a Predicate
to a Subject, sometimes that of a Subject to a Pre-
dicate. The so-called Species Proedicabz'lis, is, in the
manner of its predication, in no way distinguishable
from Genus. Man, when predicated of philosopher,
expresses a part only of the essence of its subject, i. e.
