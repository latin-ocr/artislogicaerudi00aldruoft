y Totum Loyiezcm—Totam Bletaphysicum. The propriety of
this nomenclature may be questioned. ‘⁵ Universale,” says
Burgersdyck, “ totum quoddam est; quippe multa complectitur
ut partes. Dicitur totum Loqieum, quia Logicae munus est de
universis disputare. Genus et differentia distinguuntur sola
ratione3 ideoque compositio ex genere et differentia non est
vera compositio, sed compositio rationis. Hoc totum solet
appellari totum Mecaphysicum‚ quia Metaphysica versatur circa
ea fere, quae non tam reipsa quam ratione diversa sunt,”
Inst. Loy. l. i. c. 14. But in truth, as regards mere notions,
the potential extension and comprehension are both within
the province of Logic ; and as regards things, the real essence
of a species and the actual subdivisions of a genus are both
equally without. The distinction itself is of great importance,
and has been expressed in various ways, by the terms potential
and actual whole, whole in preclieatz'on and in definition, universal
and essential whole, &a The best is that adopted by the Port-
Royal Logicians, who distinguish the eoetension or subjects of
which a notion is predicable from the comprehensim or attributes
which it involves in itself. Thus genus is a whole in extension,
species a whole in comprehension. On this important dis-
tinction, see Sir W. Hamilton's Lectures on Logic, I. p. 141.
