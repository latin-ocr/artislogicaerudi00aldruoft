INTRODUCTION. liii

A short account of these, as well as of Ploucquet's
system, is given in the Appendix to Professor De
Morgan's “ Formal Logic,” p. 323.

Kant has done more for logical science than any Kant.
philosopher since Aristo'tle3 partly 111 his distinct
treatise on the subject, and still more in the exact
examination of the forms and functions and limits of
thought which runs through the Critique of Pure Reason.
To Kant is owing, what has been so long needed, a
definition of Logic, which secures for it a distinct and
positive field of inquiry, as the Science of tlte Necessary
Laws of leouylzt. Kant also did great service in
banishing to a separate region, under the name of
Applied Logic, the psychological precepts which his
predecessors, especially the Cartesians‚ had incorporated
with the body of the science, and giving thereby to
formal thought its proper position as the object of Pure
Logic. His demonstration that an universal material
criterion of truth is not only impossible, but sels-con-
tradiotoryk, has furnished us with the principle of a
more liberal and enlightened appreciation of the real
character and value of formal thinking than can be
supplied by the whole previous history of philosophy.

At the same time, it must be admitted that the logical
system of Kant is chargeable with 0116 serious deficiency,
which has been prominently shewn in the Subsequent
history of the science. He divorces altogether his ὰ
priori science from all connection with the psycho-
logical phenomena osconsciousness, from all examination
of the actual characteristics of any determinate operation
of thoughtl. These matters he rejects as empirica13 but
without such empiricism, Logic and all pure science is
impossible. It is matter of each man's personal experi-
