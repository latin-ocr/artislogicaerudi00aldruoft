Singulis operationibus sui accidunt defectus¹.

The definition is too wide, being applicable to the immediate
infer-elices of Opposition and Conversion, as well as to the
mediate by Argumentation. In all there is a progress from
one judgment to another. Discursus is more properly the
progress froin two connected judgments to a third resulting
from their connection. Of. Port Royal Logic‚ Introd. “ On
appelle raz'sonner l'action de notre esprit, par laquelle il forme
un jugement de plusieurs autres.''

Of this division of the operations of the mind, Sir W.
Hamilton has observed‚ that “it never was proposed as a
psychologyical distribution of the cognitive faculties in ῃωιονιιῖ .·
but only as a loyicaz distribution of that seetion of them
which we denominate discursive, as those alone which are
proximately coneerned in the process of reasoning.'‘ Reid's
WorRs, p. 242, 692. Hence Aristotle's division, which is
psyclioloqiml, will not exactly correspond. The nearest ap-
proach to Simple Appi-eliension is ἡ τῶν ἀδιαιρέτων νοὴο-ιςς
but νοὴσις is variously used, and in its widest sense will
einbrace all the logical operations, and even φαντασία, which
belongs rather to the perceptive soul. See de Anima, iii.
3. 8. Judgment will eorrespond nearly to the ὑπόληψις· of cle
An. iii. 3. 7. (Of. Trendelenburg, Arist. (le Anima, p. 469.)
The latter term however is inapplicable to the cognition of
axiomatic truths. Discursus answers to διάνοια and λογισμός,
the former term being applied both to the faculty and its
operation. But there is much unecrtainty in the use of all
the above tcrms. Cf. Biese, vol. i. p. 89, 327. Hamilton's
Reid, p. 768.
