ΟΝ ΤΗΕ LOGIC OF GEOMETRY.

THE Propositions which have been regarded by
different writers as constituting the foundation of geo-
metrical demonstration, may be classified as follows.

I. Definstious, analysing the complex notions of the
several magnitudes 01· figures.

II. postulates, assuming the existence of the objects
defined.

ΙΙΙ. Axioms proper to Geometry, 01· synthetical judg-
ments, stating sels—evident properties of certain magni-
tudes.

IV. Genera] axi01ns2‚ or analyticaljudgments, logically
involving the notions of equality or inequality.

Some one or more of these, under various nameS‚ (for
the language of the several writers has been by no
means uniform‚) have been selected at different times
as the fundamental assumptions or premises from which
the conclusions of Geometry may be demonstrated. A
brief examination of each may perhaps help to clear the
question.

Ι. According to Stewart‚ the properties of geometrica]
figures follow from the Definitions of those figures3 the
general axioms being mere barren truisms, and the
axioms proper, (such as the loth, llth‚ and thh ofEuclid‚)
being theorems requiring demonstration. In this theory,

³ Ι have retained the language of the modern editions of Euclid, as
that most familiar to the majority os readers. At the same time it may
be observed‚ that this language departs widely from the original text of
Euclid himself. In that text the general axioms are called common
notiores (κοιναὶ ἔννοιαι), while the axioms proper are included among the
postulates (αἶ’-πήματα).
