in rebus ea tantum quae conveniunt, neglectis
omnibus quibus dissident ; adeoque fundamentum

abstractim have been used in various applications ; retaining
however in all the primary signification of withdrawing] the
attention from one portion of certain phenomena given in
combination to fix it on the rest. In this sense Geometrical
Magnitudes are called by Aristotle τὰ ἐξ ἀφαιρέσεως, (An. Post.
I. 18. 1.) ς because the Geometer considers only the properties
of the fimare, separating them from those of the material in
which it is found. (See An. Post. I. ὅ. 6. Meu-aph. x. 3. 7.)
On similar grounds is formed the scholastic distinction of
abstract and concrete te1·1ns; since in the former the attribute
is considered apart from the subject in which it is perceived
by the senses: e. g. sight presents to us only albem the mind
forms the conception albedo. And so Universals are gained
by abso-action, i. e. by* separating the phenomena in which a
given group of individuals resemble each other froin those in
which they differ. For this reason Locke calls all universals
abso-acc aleas,- a phrase etymologically allowable‚ but liable to
be confounded with the scholastic use of the word αὐδῶ-εισι in
a different sense. For this reason it is better to adhere to the
term universals: which has at the same time the advantage of
leaving the Logician, as such, uncommitted to any metaphysical
hypothesis as to their nature; since the Realist may interpret
Universal Substanoes, the Nominalist‚ Universa] Names, the
Conceptualist‚ Universal Notion&

Generalization, which some modern writers distinguish from
Abstraction‚ is properly a species of abstraction; viz. the divest-
ing the presentations of consciousness of the conditions of
existence in space and time, which are characteristic of indi-
viduals. This is done by the aid of signs, verbal or other,
which are at first signs of individual objects, and subsequently
of general notions. Other abstractions may exist without gene-

'ralization; but these are not processes of thought, but of per-
ception, internal or external. Thus, to fix the eye 01· ear on
a particular sight or sound exclusively, is in the widest sense
an abso—action, but not a yencral'ization. The psychological
