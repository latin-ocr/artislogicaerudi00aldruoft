and important as a Logician is George Downame,D0wname.
Praeleotor of Logio at Cambridge, afterwards Bishop

of Derry, the author of a Commentary on the Dia-

100110 of Ramus3 but the name most interesting to the

general reader is that of John Milton, who published Milton.
in 1672, two years before his death, a small volume
entitled, “ Artis Logicae Plenior Institutio ad Petri Rami
Methodum concinnata.''

It would be impossible to give any thing like a
complete history, or even a list, of the host of logical
writers of the sixteenth and subsequent centuries. A
brief account of most of them, down to his own time, will
be found in the Proecoqm'ta of Keckermann, published
in 1603. A cursory account of the modern 50110015 15
all that my present limits will allow.

Of the great schools of modern philosophy, down to Modern
the time of Kant, it is remarkable, that, though we have Logmmns.
no treatise on Logio from the hand of any of the leaders
and representatives of the several seo-ts, we find in every
case a work of the kind supplied and adapted to their
fundamental principles by one or more of their most
eminent followers. Bacon, DescarteS, and Locke have
left no logical writings, and Leibnitz only a few frag-
ments. To call the Novum Orycmum, or the Diseours de
Za Methodez or the Conduct of tlte Understandinq, a
treatise on Logic, is simply to assume for the Aristotelian
Logio a purpose never contemplated by Aristotle or his
followers, and then to olassify under the same head
works pursuing this supposed end by totally different

is sometimes called his Logia. See Hallam, Lilemlure ff Europe, vol. ii.
p. 454- ; Franck, Histoire [le la Loyiquez p. ¹250. But Descartes in this work
expressly rejects the rules and forms os Logic, as 11501055 sor the discovery
os truth, and mentions in one place (rnle 13.) the only point in which 1115
system has any thing in common with the dialecticians. In fact, this work,
though fuller, is in principle the same as the Discours cle la Mcfthode.
