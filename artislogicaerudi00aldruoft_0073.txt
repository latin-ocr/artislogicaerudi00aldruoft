off and distinguished from all others: otherwise it would
not *be an object, but the universe of all objects. In
the act of conception, therefore, when we regard certain
given attributes as constituting an object, we conceive
it as thereby limited and separated from all other
objects, as being itself and nothing else. The indefinite
ideas, therefore, corresponding to the general terms,
Thing, Object, Being in general, are not conceptS, as con-
taining no distinctive attributes3 and the general object
denoted by such terms is inconceivable. This law of
thought is expressed by the Principle of Identity,
‘⁶ Every A is A‚⁷' 01· “Every object of thought is con-
ceived as itself.''

Attributes which comply with these laws are loyically
conceivablc; but for an act of material conception, or
rather of conception combined with perception or
memory, more than this is required. A centaur, as has
before been observed, is logically as conceivable as a
horse; and, as inere thoughts, one is as legitimate as the
other. But the senses or other evidence must further
assure me of the reality of the objects, before Ι can
think of either horse or centaur as having any existence
out of my imagination. This assurance is not the result
of a law of thought, but of a fact of perception. Hence
as a general rule: all imaginary objects are conceived
as such formally ; all real objects are conceived as such
materially, that is to say, not by an act of pure con-
ception, but by uniting that act with the presence or
remembrance of other sources of information.

Formal judging is possible, affirmatively, whenever
one of the given concepts is contained in the other3
neyatz'vely, whenever one of them contradicts the other.
If the concepts P and Q have no attributes in common
or contradicting each other, I cannot determine whether

they coexist in any object without an appeal to expe-
