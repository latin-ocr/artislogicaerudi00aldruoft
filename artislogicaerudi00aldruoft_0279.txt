APPENDIX. 195

have seen, an early point of dispute among the School-
menn. On this question the authority of Aristotle is of
little avail for either side. That his treatment of the
subject has far more of a material than a formal character
is undeniable. And to those who maintain that the
Organon of Aristotle is designed as a systematic treatise
on a single subject called Logic, such testimony must be
decisive as regards both the material character of much
of the Science, and its inclusion of Definition. But
then it remains, and probably will continue to remain,
a problem, to frame a conception of Logic adequate to
the province thus assigned to it. This question has been
already treated of in the Introduction, and need not be
repeated here. It is sufficient to say that, as far as any
evidence is furnished, either by the writings of Aristotle
himself or by externa] testimony as to their original
connexion, it is no more a departure from the authority
of the Stagirite to assign a field to Logic incom-
mensurate with that of the Organon, than it is to write
a moral treatise on the basis of the Ethics‚ without
including the Politics. Leaving then the question of
authority, we may fairly assert that Logic as a formal
Science can take no cognisance of the following
points.

I. It has nothing to do with determining the physical
existence of attributes in their subjects3 which is in fact
an inquiry into the material crath of the propositions in
which such attributes are predicated. Itis true that such
propositions are by Aristotle considered as the con-
clusions of Syllogism, and so far their truth is merely
formal. But it must be remembered, that no attribute
can be syllogistically demonstrated of one subject, with-
out being in the premise asserted of another3 and it is
upon the material tru'th- of the latter proposition that the
