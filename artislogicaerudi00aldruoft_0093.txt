ᾗ. 2. QUONlAM vero, inter docendum et dispu-
tandum, neque res aliqua, neque conceptus, cui

instrumenta, iisque intellectum dirigens in coynitione rerum. Loqica
docens dicitur quae praecepta tradit; utens, quae praeceptis
utitur. Officium Logicae docentis, est tradere praecepta et
modum efficiendi instrumenta, quibus mens dirigitur in cog-
nitione rerum, instrumentorumque naturam describere. In-
strumenta Logica sunt quatuor, definitim divisio, sylloyismus
et methodus. Officium Logicae utentis. est instrumenta, cum
opus est, efficere, iisque mentem dirigere, ne in quaerenda
rerum cognitione hallucinetur.” From this it appears that
the knowledgse of ticin-qs was regarded by this school as only
the remote object of the Lofsica utens, as applied to this or
that matter, and hence not to be gained from any logical

treatise. Thus the distinction insisted upon by some critics Η ε ’

between in cognitione and in coyrzitiOiienz, is of no value; both
being merely verbal variations in expressing the same view.
This definition of Logic as an Art arose from the dialec-
tical and rhetorical innovations introduced hythe reformers
of Logic in the latter part of the fifteenth century, and was
adopted universally by Ramus and his followers, as well as
by the Peripatetico-Ramists of the school of Keckermann,
and afterwards by the Cartesians. Among the earlier philo-
sophers, the Peripatetics considered Logic to be neither Art
nor Science, but an Instrument. The Stoics regarded it as a
Science, in which they were followed by the Schoolmen.
Subsequently, in the schools of Wolf and Kant, Logic again
obtained the name of Science‚ though the former regarded it
as a practieaL the latter, more correctly, as a speculative
science. Of. Zabarella de Natura L09i0oe‚ lib. i. Smiglecii
