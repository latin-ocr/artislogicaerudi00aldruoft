symbolica] form being, A Is to Î’ as C to D3 A is X,
therefore G is X. Here it is evident that the premises

value, like that of Example, may admit of any degree,
from zero to moral certainty. Like Example too, it
has a logical value as an answer to objections. Thus,
in Butler's argument, the difficulties in Religion are
not intended logieally to prove its divine origin3 but
to shew, as is admitted by the antagonist in the ease
of the natural world, that the existence of difficulties
does not furnish a logical argument against it.
