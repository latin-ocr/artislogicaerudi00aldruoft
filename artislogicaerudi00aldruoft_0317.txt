APPENDIX. 2353

In the ἀπαγωγὴ εἷς τὸ ἀδύνατον, the proof is of the same
character. It has indeed no special reference to Dialectic,
and is frequently employed in demonstrationf3 Aristotle’s
own example being taken from Geometry. But still its
connexion with the original question is not formal, but
material ; for we assume,

All A is Β ;
All C is A;
Therefore, All C is B.

And this conclusion, from material grounds, we know to
be false. We also know (materially again) that the minor
premise is true; and all that is logical in the process is
the consequent decision that the major must be false,
and hence, by the principle of contradiction, that the
original question is true.

But one step only is wanting, to convert these material
consequences into formal ones. We have in the συλλο-
γισμὸς ἐξ ὁμολογίας clearly the germ of the Conditional
Syllogisms of Theophrastus. It needs but to cornmence
with the original hypothesis, not as a mere dialectic
convention, but as a proposition having its own inde-
pendent value, and we have at once a distinct form of
argumentation, to which the Aristotelian specimen is
related merely as a prosyllogism supporting one of the
premises. This done, no great sagacity is required to
see that the prosyllogism may in this, as in any other
case, be omitted or not, according to the material
character of the premise which it supports.

To the ἀπαγωγὴ εἷς τὸ ἀδύνατον may in like manner be
traced the origin of the Disjunctive Syllogism. The
most natural proceeding in this case is to state the two

f For the principle of contradiction may be assumed as seff-evident,
without any convention between disputants. And in this lies the principal

difference between the deductioacl impossibile and the syllogism of agree-
ment. See Anal. Pr. i. 44. 3.
