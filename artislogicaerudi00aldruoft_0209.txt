Method in either sense is not properly a part of Pure or
Formal Logic. lt is an application of Logic to the discovery
or communication of truths in material science: its rules
cannot hc determined cl priori from the laws of thought; bnt
must be gathered empirically from the examinatior] of parti-
cular sciences, and will require nlodification in many instanccs
from the particular matter with which they have to deal.

⁰ The Metlioclzis sufflationis can only be a process of inference:
for no afri-(wissement of parts is possible before they have been
discovered⁵ The discovery of general principles from individual
objects of sense, if limited to the inferential process itself,
will be Induclion. The term, however, is sometimes extended
so as to include the preliminary accumulation of individuals.
In this wider sense it will embrace the four successive steps
given by Aristotle‚ Anal. POSt. il. 19. αἴσθησις, μνήμη, ἐμπειρία,
ἐπαγωγή.

But the Metliodus Inventionis must not be absolutely limited
to Induction and its preliminaries, though these are the most
important instruments of discovery. In some sciences, as in
mathematics, truths are chiefly discovered by demonstration;
and, till so discovered, cannot, of course, be imparted to others
by the methodus doctrinae.

Induction and Syllogism are the only two methods of
inference. The Greek commentators, Ammonius and Eu*
Stratius, enumerate four, adding Division and Definition ; but
in these last there is no reasoning process. See Zabarella,
de Methodis‚ lib. iii. cap· 5 sqq. If we extend the method of
discovery beyond the process of inference proper, so as to
include any accumulation of knowledge, we may distinguish
three principal instruments. 1. Pure experience‚ applicable to
