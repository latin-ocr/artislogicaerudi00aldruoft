xxxviii INTRODUCTION.

In the second period of Scholasticism, contemporary
with Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, is Petrus
Hispanus, raised to the papa] chair as John XXI. He
died in 1-277. His Summulce Loyz'cales may be regarded
as the earliest scholastic treatise on Logic which professes
to be any thing more than an abridgment of or commentary
on portions of the Organon. But this work is especially
remarkable, as introducing for the first time the memorial
verses which form so striking a feature of the Logic of
the Schoolmen. Nearly the whole of the ordinary logical
mnemonics occur in this treatise‚ which appears to have
had no predecessor, except perhaps the imperfect syllo-
gistic mnemonic attributed to Blemmidas, which, even if
genuine, was probably unknown to the Author. The
last t1·eatise.of the Suminulaef, called Parva Loyz'calia,
contains sundry additions to the text of Aristode, in the
form of dissertations on suppositio, ampliatio, restrictio,
exponibleproposition& and othersubtletieS, more ingenious
than useful, and belonging rather to Grammar than to
Logie. To these are added notices of some popular
sophisms, worthy of Eubulides or Chrysippus3 which
are ourious, as shewing that the Scholastic Logic, like
the Aristotelian, had its eristic predecessors, whose
names the reviving literature of the period has not
rescued from oblivion.

We now come to the two chief names in the Scholastic
philosophy, Albert of Cologne, surnamed the Great,
and his pupil, Thomas Aquinas, known as the Angelic
Doctor. These have been called the Plato and Aristotle
of Scholasticism3 and, as regards the Theology of the
Schools, there is some truth in the comparison. The
master was the first to combine into a system the

f The original edition of the Sumninlae is divided into two parts3 the
abridgnient of the Organon and the Parva Loqtcalia. Subsequent Editors
subdivide it into seven treatises. See Haureau, vol. ii. p. 241.
