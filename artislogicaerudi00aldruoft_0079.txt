ness are never met with in practice. On the other hand,
the Baconian Logic, like the subordinate branches ot'
physica] science, is constructed ὰ posteriori from the
observed uniformities of nature3 and its principles and
conclusions are true primarily of the facts as they exist
in nature, secondarily only of our conceptions, so far as
they are accurate representations of the facts. Hence
the truth of the system entirely depends on the real
existence of the objects of which it treats3 and the
whole fabric would fall to the ground if the objects were
annihilated or their constitution reversed. Hence too a
conception not in accordance with facts is worse than
useless: if it is not the representation of nature as it is,
it cannot claim to be accepted as the representation of
nature as it should be.

An error of this sort becomes serious in its con-
sequences. It is a great mistake to treat various defi-
nitions of Logic as mere matters of opinion, in which
each person is at liberty to expand or contract the
boundaries of the science according to his own leading
conception. The whole province of the practice of
reasoning may be affected by an error in its theory. For
example. A writer who treats the Organon of Aristotle
and the Organon of Bacon as parts of the same system
is in consistency obliged to regard the so-called laws
of thought as being in reality laws of external nature&
and the same obligation extends to all cognate branches

⁰ Thus Mr. Mill (Loyic, vol. i. p. 235.) observes: “So long as what
were termed Universals were regarded as a peculiar kind of substances,
having an objective existence distinct from the individua] objects classed
under them, the dictum de omni conveyed an important meaning; because
it expressed the intercommunity of nature, which it was necessary upon
that theory that we should suppose to exist between those general sub-
stances and the particular substances which were subordinated to them.
That every thing predicable of the universal was predicable of thc various
individuals contained under it, was then no identical proposition, but a
statement of what was conceived as a fundamental law of thc universe.'’
