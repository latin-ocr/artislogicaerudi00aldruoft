predicates3 if they have the same predicate, we must
compare their subjects.

According to this method, it will be seen, thatin the
first figure, the predicate of the sign is to that of its
conclusion as part to whole, or as species to genus,
Hence its logical validity: whatever subject is included
under a species is necessarily included under its genus.
But in the second figure the relation is that of whole to
part, or of genus to species3 and this is illogical, the
whole genus not being included under one of its species.

But if we adopt the second interpretation, and compare
the major premise with the conclusion, we shall be com-
pelled in the first figure to compare together the two
subjects, since both propositions have the same predicate.
In this case the relation will be inverted3 the premise
being to the conclusion as an universal rule to a single
instance. In the second figure, we are at liberty to
compare either the quantity of the two propositions as
determined by their subjects, or the extent of their
respective predicateS. In either case, however, the result
is the sa1ne3 the relation remaining that of universal to
particular.

The Enthymeme in the third figure presents no diffi-
culty. thichever interpretation be adopted, the same
proposition, “ Pittacus is good,” is compared with the
conclusion, “ All wise men are good.'’ In both cases,
the comparison lies between the two subjects, and the
relation is that of particular to universal.

But perhaps the most difficult passage in this portion
of the Rhetoric is that in which Aristotle describes an
important, and previously, as he tells us, unnoticed
distinction between various classes of Enthymelnes.
Some of these, he says, belong to Rhetoric, some to
other arts and faculties. The sanie may be said of the
connexion of the Syllogism with Dialectic. Dialectical
