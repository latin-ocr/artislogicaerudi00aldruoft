¹ Of the word Dilemma, various etymologies have been
proposed; 1. a choice of alternatives offered to an adversary;
2. a double premise assumed (λῆμμα); 3. a not very probable
one given by Keckermann, ‘⁶ a δὶς λαμβάνεσθαι, quia utrinque
capit et constringit adversarium contra quem adducitur.’⁷ The
first seems to be adopted by Aldrich, and is perhaps supported
by Cassiodorus, Expos. in Ps. 138, 9. “ Dssemma, quod fit ex
duabus propositionibus pluribusve, ex quibus quicquid electum
fuerit, contrarium esse non dubium est.'⁷ Cf. Victorinus in
1 Rhet. Cic. 86. But whatever be the origin of the word, it
was certainly employed as synonymous with the compleoeio of
Cicero, (de Inv. l. 29.) This is expressly stated by Servius,
(on AEn. ii. 675.) and the word had been previously used in a
similar sense by the Greek rhetoricians. See Hermogenes,
de Inv. p. 167, ed. VValz; Apsines, Ars Rhet. p. 524. In this
sense it may be defined, (omitting the adversary, as belonging
rather to Rhetoric or Dialectic than Logic‚) “A syllogism,
having a conditional major premise with more than one
antecedent, and a disjunctive minor.’' Its different forms
may be thus exhibited:

I. Simple Constructive.
IfAis B, C isD; andifEis F, C isD;
But either Ais B, or E is F;
C is D.

II. Complex Constructive.
lfA is B, C is D; and if E is F, G is- H:
But either A is B, or E is F;
lfiithcr (¹ is D, (η- (i is H.
