treatise called Sic et Non, a fragment on Genera and
Species, erroneously ascribed to Abelardy, and some
genuine logical writingS, consisting of glosses on the
original and translated works of Boethius, and a distinct
treatise called Dialectica. The glosses are of little
value, but the Dialectica is one of the inost important
monuments of the scholastic philosophy. At first sight
it appears to be a commentary3 but, though the titles of
the work follow Aristode, Porphyry, and Boethius, it is
in many respects an original and independent treatise².
The writings of Abelard and his contemporaries in the
early part of the twelfth century form the commencement
of a new epoch in the mediaeval Logic, which may be
regarded as that of the scholastic teaching properly so
called. In the previous centuries the Organon of Aris-
totle appears to have been directly known only in those
portions which had been illustrated by the Commentaries
of Boethius, viz. the Categories and the De Inter-
pretatione, the translations of the other books being
unknown. With the twelfth century commences a direct
acquaintance with the entire Organon, partly through
the translations of Boethius, and even with some trace of
other sourcesfl. The other writings of Aristotle appear
to have remained unknown till a somewhat later period b.

(Introduction, p. li,) is os opinion that the latter portions os the Organon
wore not known at this time in any direct translation, but only through
the writings of Boethius on tho same subjects. Α direct translation of
these books certainly existed among tho writings os Boethius, though it is
uncertain when this translation first bet-anic known to tho mediaeval
logicinns.
