having given to me the concepts P and Q, I can pro-
nounce “P is Q‚’' or ‘⁶ P is not Q‚'’ without a similar
appeal, this is formal judyitzq. If, having given to me
the judgments ‘⁶ W is X,” “ Y is Z,'' Ι can elicit a con-
clusion from them alone, this is formal reasom'ny. The
term emperience is here used in a wide sense, for all
accidental knowledge, all that is not part and parcel of
the thinking act itself.

One condition of formal conceiving is, that the attri—
butes given must not contradict one another. There
is no contradiction between the notions of a horse’s
body and a man's head. A centaur therefore is as
conceivable as a man or a horse, whether such a
creature exists in nature or not. But if we try to
conceive a surface both black and white in the same
portion, the attempt to individualize the attributes by
applying them to an object shews at once their incom-
patibility. Such a combination of attributes is incapable
of representing any possible object. Hence vwe have a
law of thought, or condition oflogical possibility3 namely,
that whatever is contradictory is inconceivable. This
is the well-known Principle of Contradiction, the most
general expression of which is, “ nothing can be A and
not A,'’ or “no object can be conceived under contra-
dictory att1·ibutes.⁷’

Another law of thought may be derived from the fact
that all thought is representative of possible objects of
intuitiony. Hence, whatever limits our constitution im-
poses &priori 011 the presentations of intuition, the same
limits hold good of the representations of thought. Now
intuition is possible only under the condition of limit-
ation by differences. An object of intuition, as such,
posscsses definite characteristics, by which it is marked
