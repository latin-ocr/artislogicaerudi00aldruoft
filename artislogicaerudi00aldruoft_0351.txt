APPENDIX. 267

alone the scheme answering to a given notion can be
formedk. Mr. Wedgwood transfers these “conditions
of the sensible intuition’' to the definitions of his ele-
mentary magnitudes, the straight line and the plane,
which he defines, not by a description of the appearance
which they present to the eye or the imagination, as
magnitudes already exisffing, but by a statement of the
manner in which they may be supposed to be generated
by motion from a given point. Such statements contain
considerably more than a mere analysis os the attributes
>indispensable to the conception of the magnitudes in
question: they contain the assertion that a magnitude
which our intuition‚ whether pure or empirical, presents
to us as having a certain form, and which is already
conceived or known by that form, possessesalso a
certain property or properties in respect of its distance
and direction with regard to a given point. Assertions
of this kind, as being synthetical and not analytical
judgments, would be classed by Kant as Axioms‚ not as
Definitions.

As an appropriate conclusion to this note, Ι subjoin a
specimen of Euclid reduced to syllogisms‚ extracted
from the very curicus and rare Analyses Geometrz'cae of
Herlinus and Dasypodius. Ι have selected the fifth
proposition of the first book, as that which has also
been analysed by Mr. Mill1. To the curious in such
subjects it may be interesting to compare the two
demonstrations.
