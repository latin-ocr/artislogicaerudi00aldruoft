the principle of superposition may be applied: but even
here it adds nothing to their evidence. Magnitudes
given as the sums of equal magnitudes are ipso facto
thought as equa13 and to have recourse to super—
position tends to confound the evidence of logical
necessity resting on the laws of thought with that of
geometrica] necessity resting on the conditions of in—
tuition.

Much error and confusion on this subject might
have been avoided, had modern philosophers observed
Aristotle's distinction between ἀρχαὶ ἐξ ὧν, or assumptions
from which we reason, and ἀρχαὶ περὶ δ’, or assumptions
about the objects of our reasoning. In the former class
he rightly places the axioms ; in the latter, the definitions.
But the true distinction between the axioms proper
and the definitions, as synthetical and analytica] judg-
ments, has not, I think, been as yet accurately carried
out in reference to Geomeny,

 

The above remarks were written as an appendix to
a pamphlet of mine 011 the Limits of Demonstrative
Science, published in 1853. ln the remainder of this
note, Ι propose to resume a question which was then
only partially considered, and to point out what appears
to be the chief deficicncy in the logical arrangement of
geometrical principles.

Plato asserted that mathematica] demonstration was
founded on hypotheses& Aristotle in like manner enu-
merates hypotheseS, along with definitions, among the
proper principles of science g. By this term both philo-
sophers appear to have meant the same thing3 namely,
that the real existence of the objects of demonstration is
not proved, but supposed. If there exist any where
