PREFACE. ix

conclusion : it is possible so to overwhelm him with
assertion, as to leave him no choice but that of
blind submission to the ipse dixit of his tutor or
the ipse scripsit of his text-book. The same
difficulty meets the editor. In controverting
the positions of a work which for more than a
century and a half has enjoyed the sanction of
the Universsty, somewhat more of the verecunde
dissentio is becoming than can always bc comprised
within the necessary limits of a foot—note. The
further discussion of such points in an Appendix
has iu some instances unavoidably produced a
certain amount of repetition. This however, though
injurious to the form of the work, will, it is hoped,
not render it the less serviceable to that not in-
considerable class of students
οἷς οὐδὲ τςὶς λέγοντες ἐξικνούμεθα.

Α few passages omitted iu recent editions of the
Compendium have been restored in the present.
This, however, has been done but sparingly. An
account of the Arbor Porphyricma has been trans-
ferred to the first chapter from its original place in
the Penus Logica. The obvious utility of the
insertion will, it is hoped, warrant the liberty iu
this single instance taken with the text.

The references to Aristotle have been adapted
to the Oxford reprint of Bekker’s text. In
Germany, a custom seems to be gaining ground
of referring to the pages of the Berlin edition,
but that work has not been sufficiently circulated
