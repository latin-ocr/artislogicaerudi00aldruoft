called Canonic, merely as an adjuncti to physica] science.
They paid no regard to Syllogism, Induction, or Defi-
nition, but confined their logical method to a set of
rnles for the investigation of physica] truthd. A detailed
account of these is given by Gassendi, De Oriyz'ne
Loyz‘cae, c. 7.

To the Philosophers succeeded the Commentators.
These contributed but little new material to logical
science, but did a good deal for the explanation and
illustration of the text of Aristotle, and assisted in some
degree in fixing the language of the sciencee. The
Greek Commentators on the Organon are principally
valuable to a modern reader, from the interesting his-
torical notices which they furnish of philosophers whose
original contributions to the science have perished.
Of the extant Greek Commentators, the earliest and
best is Alexander of Aphrodisiasf, whose eminence is
testified by the title of tlae Commentator (ὁ ἐξηγητής), a
title afterwards given to the Arabian Averroes. The
school of Greek Commentators extends to the latter
part of the sixth century: the principal writers, after
Alexander, are Themistius, Ammonius, David the
Armenian, Simplicius, and Philoponus.

The only important addition to the matter of logical
science emanated from the Neo-Platonic school. The
εἷσαγωγῆ or Introduction to the CategorieS, written by
Porphyry in the third century, is the original source of

important commcntary cf his is extant. Of the numerous logical writings
attributed to him, there rcmains only a small trcatisc‚ περὶ τῶν παρὰ τὴν
