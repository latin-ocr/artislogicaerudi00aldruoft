investigates the unvarying laws of the heavenly phe-
nomena3 but a practical science of Logic, to preserve
the mind from error, would be as absurd as an Astrononiy
proposing to control and regulate the planets in their
courses. From these considerations it follows that,
even granting Logic to be, under existing circumstances,
both a speculative and a practical science, yet the
former is an essential, the latter an accidental feature3
the one is necessarily interwoven with the elements of
the system, the other is a contingent result of the
infirmities of those who possess it.

On the other hand, the Loyz'ca utens may be either
Science or Art, according to the purpose to which it is
applied¹'. Whenever reasonings are employed on any
special object of knowledge, there we have an instance
os the Loqica utens. The opposite view, which is some-
times taken on account of Aristotle's distinction between
the loyical and the analytical or physieal syllogism,
arises from a confusion between the Aristotelian and
the later scnses of the term Zoyical.

It would be both tedicus and unnecessary to discuss
in detail the various accounts that have been given of
the object of Logic, by those who are agreed as to its
genus. Many of these may be passed over, as being
merely verbal varieties of the same fundamental views.
One or two statements, however, require a brief notice,

r “ Distinctio peccat, quia auctores distinctionis vocant Logivzun uten-
