INTRODUCTION. xix

On the other hand, the method of Socrates partook Socrates.
largely of the πειραστικῆ, or tentative, which Aristotle
describes as follows, ἡ γάρ megae-rm& ἐστι διαλεκτική τις καὶ
θεωρεῖ οὐ τὸν εἰδότα ἀλλὰ τὸν ἀγνοοῦντα καὶ προσποιούμενον
The opinion which Socrates entertained of the pro-
fessions of his contemporaries, and his manner of
exposing their ignorance, appears in his well-known
explanation of the oracle which pronounced him the
wisest of menW3 ancl the same conviction and exposure
of ignorance and pretension constantly appear in the
Platonic dialogues, as well as in the Memorabilia of
Xenophon’‘⁴ For this purpose, he insists on the superior
fitness of bis own brief discourses to the longer mode of
reasoning employed by some of the Sophists, and says
that many orators can discourse ably at length, but that,
if exaininecl by searching questions, they are like written
books, unable to replyy. In the same spirit, like Bacon
and Descartes in modern times, he urges the necessity
of a purification of the mind from prejudice and false
opinions, as a necessary preliminary to the investigation
of truth3 the principa] means of purification being Dia-
lecticz.

In all this, as well as in the Dialectic of Plato, we find
no anticipation of any important part of the Aristo-
telian Analyti03 though the various modifications of the
dialectic form may have contributed more or less to that
systematized method of disputation exhibited in the
two last t1·eatisesof the Organon. The antecedents of
Aristotle's more strictly logical labours appear in other
and more subordinate points of the philosophy of his
predecessors. We may pass over, as [inquestionably
