from which, after I. 28. prove Simson’s axiorn xii as a
theorem. Remark that the distinction of postulate
and axiom‚ as problenp and tlzeorem, could not have been
Euclid’s notion,for he does not recognise the last
distinction; both are with him simply propositions.
The expressed six postulates of Euclid are not the
only ones which occur3 others are tacitly adopted, as
will presently appear. Nothing should be tacitly assumed
by those who will not assume without express statement,
that ‘⁶ two straight lines cannot inclose a space.’'

‘⁶ l. 1. The following postulates are demanded: “if
two figures which have one or more points in common
have each a point which is not in the other, the bound-
aries of those figures must cut,” and “every point is
without or within a circle, according as its distance
from the centre is more or less than the radius.⁷’ With
less, the intersection of the circles cannot be proved.
Ι. 4. This postulate is assumed, “any figure may be
removed from place to place without alteration of form,
and a plane figure may be turned round on the plane.''
But for this right to turn, Ι. 4. would not prove I. 5.’'

ln the general principles of Professor De Morgan's
criticism I fully concur, though slightly differing from
one or two of his details. Definitions iii. and vi. are syn-
thetica] judgments, not developing the conceptions of
the point and straight line, but affirming a property of
each. These then should be classed among the axioms,
or, as Mr. De Morgan more properly terms them, the
postulates, Definitions i, ii, iv, v, vii, viii, ix, are not
really employed as conceptions, but only serve to refer us
to the corresponding intuition; which in every case is
the basis of onc or more axioms, implied, if not expressly
stated. Among such axioms must bc classed the follow—
ing assumption& “ Two lines can meet each other, and
