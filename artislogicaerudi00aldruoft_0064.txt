certain conditionsÍ¾ but it does not become an Art until
those conditions are complied with, and it may exist
as a Science without them. The ordinary distinction
between the man of theory and the man of practice is a
proof of this. A man may have a scientific knowledge
of music, and yet have no power of playing on any
instrument. He may be acquainted with the principles
of perspective, without any skill in the use of the pencil.
He may know the mathematica] principles of Optics,
and yet be sadly at a loss if required to make a pair of
spectacleS. He may have studied the anatomy of the
human frame, and yet be unable to perform a surgical
operation. He may talk like a Curius, and live like a
Bacchanal. And in like manner, he may be familiar
with Barbara, Odorem, and Baralipton, but in practice
be a weak and inconclusive reasoner. On the other
hand, he may possess Art without Science, that is to say,
he may have considerable dexterity in the practice of
any operation, without being able to give a clear account
of the principles on which it is conducted. Science
is no more Art because the man of science may become
an artist, than a boy is a inan because he may grow up
into one. Nay, far less 303 for the boy becomes a man
in the course of nature, without any effort of his own3
while the man of theory may remain a man of theory all
his life, without ever learning to apply his knowledge to
practice.

then we are askcd, What is Logic? it is clearly
meant, What is the object of which books 011 Logic
treat. No treatise on Logic can give all its practical
applications. lt can at best select only a few speci-
mens, and these by way of example, not as an essentia]
part of the theory.- But it professes to give, and is
bound to give, tho entire principles of reasmfing, or
rather of thinking in general, even though it. illustr-ates
