The true character of hypothetical reasoning is lost
sight ofin the examples commonly selected by Logicians,
which have for their subject a proper name, and indicate,
not a general relation of reason and consequent between
two notions, but certain accidental circumstances in the
history of an individual. The adoption of this type has
led to the logical anomaly, that the propositions of a
hypothetical syllogism are generally stated without any
designate quantity3 whereas it is obvious that, wherever
concepts are compared together in any form of reasoning,
two distinct conclusions may follow, according to the
quantity assigned. For example: to the prenfise, “ If men
are wise, they will consult their permanent interests‚''
we may supply two minors and conclusions, in the con-
structive form, according as we affirm the antecedent of
all men or of Some. It thus becomes necessary to dis-
tinguish between two different kinds of apparent hypo-
thetica] syllogisms3 those in which the inference is froin
a general hypothesis to all or some of its special
instances‚ and those in which a relation between two
individual facts is assumed as a hypothesis leading to
a singular conclusion. The former contain a general
relation of determining and determinednotion, which
may always be expressed in three terms3 the occasional
employment of four being only an accidental variety of
language. Thus the general assertion, “ If any country
is justly governed, the pcoplc arc happy,” is equivalent
to, “If any country is justly governcd, it has happy
peoplc.” This we may apply to special instances; all
comm-ies, some countrz’es, or this country, being asserted
to bc justly governed: and this is properly leypotlzetical
reasoniny. The latter denoto only a material connection
between two single facts, either os which may, to certain
