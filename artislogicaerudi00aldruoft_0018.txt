xiv INTRODUCTION.

ferred to Zeno the Stoie. The division of Philosophy
into Logie, Physies. and Ethies, probably originated
with this Plrilosophei·⁰, and the use of the name Loyic in
Cicero is principally in relation to the Stoieal doctrinesd.
For the application of the term to the eontents of the
Aristotelian Organon, the Greek eomrnentators upon
Aristotle are our earliest extant authority. Alexander
of Aphrodisias, the oldest of these whose works have
eonie down to use, speaks of ἡ λογικὴ καὶ συλλογιστικὴ
πραγματεία as containing under it ἀποδεικτική, διαλεκτικῆ,
magnanimi, and coptffrtxr'jf. Here, while Dialectie retains
its Aristotelian sense, Loyz'c is extended so as to include
the syllogistie theory in general, and its particular appli-
cations to necessary and probable matter. A similar
extension of Dialectic is found in the eonnnentaries of
David the Armenian33 and Philoponus uses both terms
as synonyrnous, and in the same extenth.

⁰ Laert.vii. 39. Pseuclo-Plu‘tarcli‚De Plac. Phili l. This division is some-
times attributed to Plato. (Cf. Cicero. Qnaest. Λιαά. 1. ]9. De Fin. i. 22.
Euseb. Prcep. Evan. xi. l. Augustin, De Civ.D‹.¹i‚ viii. 4.) But none of the
three names oeeur 111 any of the extant Platonie writings3 and a different
division of seiences into coynitive and praetia-al is intimated by Plato
himself, Polit. p. 258. Indeed the state ot' philosophy in Plato's day
would hardly allow of the Stoieal division being made. Cf. Van Heusde,
Initia Plu'l. Platon. p. 41. 117. Aristotle's supposed adoption of the same
tlireefold elassifieation is still more questionable3 being founded on a
misinterpretation of Topica, i. 14. 4. and. at variance, as well with the
earliest cormnentary on that passage, as with Aristotle’s constant use of
the word λογικός, and with his well-known division of theoretieal Philo·
sophy into Physics, Madrenraffies, and Theology. ,

would seem to roser this usage of the word to tho elder l‘eripatvties, but
we must reject his reference to Aristotle.
