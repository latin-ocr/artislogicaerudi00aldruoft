APPENDIX. 171

Mr. Mill. In these, the subject is neither a word nor
a notion, but the several individual things of which
a certain notion is predicable. For example, in the
Proposition, “ All men are mortal‚’' we do not mean
that the conception Man includes Mortality‚ but that the
individuals possessing the attributes comprehended in
the former notion possess also those comprehended in
the latter.

In distinguishing a certain portion of these Propo·
sitions as predicating Property, we must divest ourselves
altogether of the notion of necessary or contingent con-
nexion, and regard the word purely as a translation of
the Aristotelian ἴδιον. These Propositions assert, not
merely that certain objects possess certain attributes, but
that they alone possess them. This assertion, however,
is very imperfectly expressed in the ordinary form of the
affirmative proposition. The judgment, ‘⁴ all equilateral
triangles are equiangular‚'’ does not by its mere form
imply that all equiangular triangles are equilateral. This
knowledge is conveyed by the geometrical matter, not by
the logical form. To remedy this defect of language‚ it
is necessary in a system of formal Logic to distinguish
the propositions in which property is predicated from
those in which accident is predicated‚ by attaching an
universal sign to the predicate. ‘⁶ All equilateral triangles
are all equiangular‚’' will then denote that the predicate
is a property of the subject3 while “ all men are some
m01·tals,” distinguishes by the particular sign that the
predicate is an accident.

The distinction adopted by Aldrich between Property
and Accident, as necessarily οι· contingently connected
with the subject, is untenable in formal Logic. If not
expressed in the copula, it implies the extralogical
knowledge of a law of connexion existing o'r not between
the objects signified by'the terms3 a law which cannot
