the necessary, the impossible, the concinam& and the possible.
(dvayxaiov—<i&uvarov-—e’vdexdfaeevov—-Svvarov.) These he afterwards,
Anal. Pr. i. Q. 1. reduces to two, the necessary and the con-
tingent. See St. Hilaire‘s Translation, Preface‚ p. 66. That
he adds the true and the false is questionable; the words
ἀληθές, οὐκ ἀληθές, in de Int. 12. 10. are perhaps only intended
to mark the previous four pairs as contradictories, of which
the one must be true, the other false. Subsequent Logicians,
following the Greek Commentators, have multiplied the
number of modes acl infinitum. Any adverb annexed to the
predicate, “ homo currit velociter? or even an adjective qualifying
the subject, “ homo albus currit‚” was regarded as forming a
modal. The norme τρόπος, as applied both to the modes of
propositions and to those of syllogisms, is not Aristotelian,
but comes from the Greek Commentators. (Ammonius, Schol.
p. 130. a. 16.)

The post-Aristotelian modes affect the subject or the
predicate alone, not the relation between them. They are
thus only pure propositions with complex terms, as is re-
marked by Melanchthon, Erotemata. Dialectica, p. 132, ed. 1568.
Aristotle's modes affeet the copula and the manner of
thinking, and are psychologically distinct forms of the pro-
position, as they are rightly treated by Kant, Kritik der r. V.
p. 71. But in a logical point of view, the distinction of
modals is unimportant, as not influencing any further process
of pure thinking. For this reason they are out of place in the
logical writings of Kant and his followers. See further,

‘De messa—rosa ὑπάρχειν. We find two expressions in
Aristotle, both of which are sometimes rendered by “ being] in.”
1. ὑπάρχειν, by which the predicate is said to be in the subject.
This iS equivalent ‘CO κατηγορεῖσθαι. Τὸ Α ὑπάρχει παντὶ τῷ Β = τὸ
A κατηγορεῖται κατὰ παντὸς τοῦ B Ξ Α inest omni Β. 2. εἶναι ε’ν,
by which tho subject is said to be in the predicate. A ἐστιν ἐν
ὅλῳ τῷ Β = Omma Α est B. This is exactly the reverso of
