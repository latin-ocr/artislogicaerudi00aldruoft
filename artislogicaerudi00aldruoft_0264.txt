come under one of the four heads of Genus, Definition‚
Property‚ or Accident‚ Come as simple terms under one
of the ten Categories. The Metaphysical view of the
Categories is not materially different. In that work,
Aristotle enumerates the different senses in which the
term Bez‘ozy (τό ὃν) is used, in order to determine in what
sense it is applied to the object of metaphysica] in-
quiriesm. Beiny sometimes signifies the accidental
connection of an attribute with a subject, or of two
attributes with a common subject. lt is also used co-
extensively with the Categories in predicati0n3 thus we
may say, ἄνθρωπος ὑγιαίνει, or ἅνθρωπος ὑγιαίνων ἐστίν, ἅνθρω-
πος τέμνει, οι· ἅνθρωπος τέμνων ἐστίν, the verb εἶναι being
admissible as a copula in any proposition, whatever may
be the category of its predicaten. But substance is the
πρώτως ἔν, the proper object of metaphysios0. In this
account, Aristotle does not appear to have distinguished
between the verb substantive, as denoting real existence,
and the copula as denoting the coexistence of notions in
the mind3 but, as in other placeS‚ the Categories are
enumerated, not as an exhaustive catalogue of existing
things, but as a list of different modes of predicating by the
copula. They thus originally belong to Grammar, rather
than to Logic or Metaphysics‚ though the treatment of
latter philosophers, perhaps in some degree sanctioned
by Aristotle himself, has brought then] into closer con-
nection with the latter scienees, and overlooked their
proper relation to the formerP.
