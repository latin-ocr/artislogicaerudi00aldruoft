of objects, but from the analysis of assertione. This is
manifest from the name and from the manner of treat-
ment. Κατηγορία, κατηγορεῖν, κατηγόρημα, κατεγοςούμενον,
κατηγορικός, have all primarily reference to forms of
speech3 the term κατηγορία being used by Aristotle as
well for any predicate term, as for the highest gene-
ralizations under which predicates can be classedf. In
qthe beginning of the treatise on the OategorieS, terms as
combined in a proposition are made to precede terms
regarded separatelyg3 and the proposition, as the only
assertioni capable of truth and falsehood, appears to be
regarded as the unit of speech, of which the simple term
is but a fractional elementh.

It is therefore probable, that the Aristotelian distinction
of Categories arose from the resolution of the proposition
and a classification of the grammatica] distinctions indi-
cated by its parts. The noun substantive leads us to the
category of οὐσία, the adjectives of number and of quality
to ποσόν and ποιόν, the adjective of colnparison to πρός τι,
the adverbs of place and time to ποῦ and ποτέ, the different
forms of the verb, intransitive, praeterite, active, and pas-
sive to κεῖσθαι, ἔχειν, ποιεῖν, and πάσχεινῑ. It is true that in
his subsequent treatment the philosopher by no means
adheres strictly to the grammatica] point of view, and
that his classification may, even on his own principles,
be considerably sirnplffied, but it must be remembered,
that at that time the science of Grammar was in its
infancy, that its forms of speech had not been analysed
completely, nor its boundaries clearly separated from
those of Logic and Metaphysics.
