lxii INTRO'DUCTION.

Logicians of eminence, who are agreed as to the genus
of Logic, are at issue as to its species. Granted that
Logic is a science‚ is it speculative or practica] ? Wolf,
the ablest of the German writers 011 Logic before Κ11111,
while distinguishing accurately between Science and
Art, regards Logic as belonging to the practicaL not to
the speculative 8131011008, the knowledge which it fur-
nishes being subservient to the discipline of the mind
and the acquisition of further truths. Accordingly
he defines Logic as “ Scientia dirigendi facultatem cog-
noscitivam in cognoscenda veritate⁰.'’ On the other
hand, Kant‚ who defines Logic as “the Science of the
necessary lavvs of the Understanding and the Reason‚”
considers and treats it as speculativeP, and the same
view is well maintained by the excellent French trans-
lator of the Organon, M. St. Hilaire, whose language
may be quoted as an accurate and admirably expressed
statement of 1110 true purpose of Logic and the spirit in
which it should be studied. ‘⁴ Sans la logique, l'esprit
de l'homme peut admirablement agir, admirablernent
raisonner3 mais sans elle, il ne se 0011111111 pas tout
entier: il ignore l'une de ses parties les plus belles et
les plus secondes. La logique la lui fait connaitre.
Voila son utilite: elle ne peut pas en avoir (l'aut1·e‘¹.⁷⁷
That this latter is the true view is manifest, as soon as
we distinguish accurately between the essentia] con-
tents of Logic and its accidenta] applications. The
benefits performed by Logic as a medicine of the mind,
however highly we may be disposed to rate them, are
