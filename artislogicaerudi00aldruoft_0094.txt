αὐταί· ὢν μέντοι ταῦτα σημεῖα πρώτως ταύτὰ πᾶσι παθήματα τῆς ψυχῆς,

between σημεῖον and ὁμοίωμα, see Waitz, vol. i. p. 324.

Ρ What Aldrich calls simply Vosc, is called by Aristotle φωνὴ
σημαντικὴ, and by Boethius and Petrus Hispanus, Vox significativa
ad placitum. In the latter case, Vox is extendes] to the gram-

* matical word ; in the former, it is limited to what may be called

the Vox Losyiccc. Logic differs from Grammar, in considering
language simply as the interpretation of thought, (the ἑρμηνεία of
Aristotle‚) not as in any way expressive of the passione or the
will. Logic therefore solely regards words as the signs os an
operation of the reason; and hence its simplest words are the
noun and the verb, which alone are perse signs of conceptione.
Syncategorems, being not significative but consignificative‚
are excluded from Logic, but recognised by Graminar. So
Aristotle, in the De Inteipretatione, treats only of the noun
and the verb. In the Poetics‚ ch. 20. he adds the φωναὶ ίίσημοι,
tho conjunction and the article. Cf. Hamis, Hermes, ch. iii.
On the distinction between tho logical and tho grammatical
proposition, some good remarks will bo found in Du Marsais,
Principes dc Grammaire, p. 321.
