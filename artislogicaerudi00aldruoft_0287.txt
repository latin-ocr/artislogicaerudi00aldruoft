APPENDrx. -203

And even with respect to principles allowed to be in-
ductive, the actual previous assumption of every possible
instance is not necessarily implied. And it is here that
an able defender of the Syllogism, Mr. Mill, has taken a
low and inadequate ground, a ground too, inconsistent
with his own subsequent analysis of the process of
Induction. His defence in sact amounts to an abandon-
ing of all formal reasoning. All reasoning, he tells us,
is really from particulars to particulars. But in that
case, all inference must depend upon the matter, and
cannot be reduced to any general type. If, for example,
I conclude that a man now living is mortal, solely from
the premises, ‘⁶ A, Β, and C, who are dead, were mortal,
and this man resembles them in certain other attributes
of humanity ;’' I may, by an argument of precisely the
same form, prove any given man to be six feet high,
because A, B, and C, whom he resembles in the common
attributes of humanity, were all of that stature.

This portion of the question resolves itself into the
following. What do we mean when we assert that all
men are mortal? Is it merely a concise mode of stating
that Socrates and Plato possess this attribute, in common
with a number of other individuals, quos mmo perscribere
Zonyum est? If so, to argue, “ Socrates is one of the
individuals above mentioned, therefore he is mortal,’'
is, if not a beyyiny of the question, at least a needless
repetition of a previous statement.

But, in fact, the Universa] Proposition means no such
thing. It means that, by virtue of a certain established
law, certain attributes, or groups of attributes, are always
so united, that in whatever individuals we find the one,
we may look upon them as an infallible mark of the
other. A conviction of this kind however, as it can
never be gained by any mere observation of particulars,
