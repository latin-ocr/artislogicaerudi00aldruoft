:210 APPENDIX.

envy hate :'’ the latter is a sirzyular Proposstion, which
however is not regarded as a sign, except relatively to
some other Proposition, which it is supposed may be
inferred from it. The εἰκός, when employed in an
Enfflymeme, will form the major premise of a Syllogism

such as the following:
Most men who envy hate,
This man envies,
Therefore, This man (probably) hates.

The reasoning is logically faulty3 for, the major premise
not being absolutely universal, the middle term is not
distributed.

The σημεῖον will form one premise of a Syllogism which
may be iu any of the three figures, as in the following

examples :

Fig. Ι. Fig. 2.
All ambitious men are liberal; All pregnant women are pale,
Pittacus is ambitious (Σ), This woman is pale, (Σ),
Therefore, Pittacus is liberal. Therefore‚ She is pregnant.
Fig. 3.

Pittacus is good (Σ) ⁰,
Pittacus is wisc,
Therefore, All wiee men are good.

c In the first and second figures, the σημεῖον is clearly the minor
premise; this alone being singular. In the third, as far as quantity is
concerned, we may choose between both premiscs. It seems more natural
however to prefer the maj0r3 because, in assigning a reason sor our belief
in a given proposition, we should naturally state a premise having either
the same predicate or the same subject ,· not one in which the predicate of
the premise is the subject of the conclusion. For example: Why do you
believe Pittacus to be liberal? Because he is ambitious. Why do you
believe wise nien to be good? Because Pittacus is good. This is far more
natural than to answcr, “Because Pittacus is wise.’' The same con-
sideration will surnish the data for interpreting an obscure passage iu
Anal. Pr. ii. 26. 5. which however it would exeeed my present limits to
attempt. The reader will find it rightly explained in a note to St. Hilaire's
Translatiom vol. ii. p. ³341. with the exception that the syllogism may be
inore clearly stated in Cesare than in Camestres.
