accidental only, and arise from causes externa] to the
science itself: its speculative character, as an inquiry
into the laws of thought, is interna] and essential. To
the twofold character of Logic, two conditions are neces-
sary. Firstly, that there should exist certain mental
laws to which every sound thinker is bound to conform.
Secondly, that it should be possible to transgress those
laws, or to think unsoundly. On the former of these
conditions depends the possibility of Logic as a specu-
lative science: on the latter, its possibility as a practica]
science. Now if we look at these two conditions with
reference to the actual coutents of pure Legio, it is
manifest that the abrogation of the first would utterly
annihilate the whole science3 whereas the abrogation
of the second would at most only necessitate the removal
of a few excrescences, leaving the main body of logical
doctrine substantially as it is at present. Suppose, for
example, that the difference between sound and unsound
reasoning could be discerned in individual cases as a
matter of fact, but that we had no power of classifying the
several instances of each and referring them to common
principles. It is clear that under such a supposition,
the present contents of Logic, speculative and practical‚
could have no existence. The number of sound and
unsound thinkers in the world might remain much as
it is now3 but the impossibility of investigating the
principles of the one and applying them to the cor-
rection of the other, would make a system of Logic
unattainable. But let us imagine, on the other hand,
a race of intelligent beings, subject to the same laws of
thought as mankind, but incapable of transgressing them
in practice. The elements of existing Logic, the Con-
cept, the Judgment, the Syllogism, would remain
unaltered. Logic‚ as a speculative science, would
investigate the laws of unerring reason, as Astronomy
