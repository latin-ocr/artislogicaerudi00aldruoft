INTRODUCTION. xliii

A more formidable assault was made in 1543 by Ramus, Ramus.
who not only devoted a special work to the criticism of
Aristotlet, but, adopting the dialectical and rhetorical
innovations of the earlier reformers, composed a new
system of Logic in opposition to the Aristotelian. He
complains of the want of a definition os Logic in
Aristotle, and treats it himself as the Art of Disser-
tatiom· its principal parts being Invention and Jadqment.
These he investigates at length in his Dialectieae In-
stitutiones and Sclcolce Dialecticae, and in his Dia-
lectique, the earliest work on the subject in the French
language. Invention he treats chiefly rhetorically‚
giving an account of arguments artificia] and inartificial,
and loci for establishing them. Arqument in Ramus
denotes any term of a question, not, as in Cicero, the
middle. Of Judqment he admits three degrees, Axiom,
(p1·oposition,) Syllogism, and Method. In the earlier
editions of his Dialectie he admits the three Aristotelian
figures, but afterwards rejects the third. Each figure
has six moods, two yeneral (universal), two special (parti-
cular), and two proper (singular). Method he divides
into Methodus Doctrinae, and Methodus Prudentiae. He
rejects, as extralogical, the Categories, the Hei-meneia‚
and the Examination of Fallacies. Ramus, as may be
seen even from the above cursory notice, introduced
many needless alterations in the language of Logic.
In his logical innovatione, he is partly indebted to
Rodolphus Agricola and Johannes Sturmius3 and, for

some of his attacks on the Aristoteliam, to Valla and
Vivesu.

² Aristotelicae Animadversfflnes, a title also given to the Scholae Dialectieae.
The two works must not he confounded together.
