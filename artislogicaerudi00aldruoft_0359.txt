ternis, are not examined, but assuined3 and the only pos—
sible logical fault must consist in drawing a conclusion
incompatible with the premises themselves, or with some-
thing which they imply. ln these two cases, the only
possible instances of inconceivability must arise from
a direct or indirect Contradiction.

A Fallacy, according to Aristotle, is a reasoning which,
either in matter or form or both, appears to be that
which it is n0t0. Extending this definition from the
process of reasoning to that of thought in general, we
may regard any thought as fallacious, which, in form or
matter, has an apparent but not a real validity3 and a
Logical or Formal Fallacy is one which exhibits an ap-
parent but not a real conformity to the Laws of Thought.
An apparent thought may thus be formally fallacious in
two ways, either generally, because it is not a thought
at all, or specially, because it is not the kind of thought
which it professes to be. For the elements of a judg-
ment may be perfectly legitimate as object-s of con-
ception, but self-destructive when united together as
parts of a judgment3 and the premises and conclusion
of a syllogism may be valid, even all together, as in-
dependent judgments, yet involve a concealed contra-
diction when placed in the relation of antecedents and
consequent in an act of reasoning. Thus, isit be argued
“All A is B, G is not A, therefore C is not B,” it is
obvious that the three statements, viewed merely as judg-
ments, may be all true together. But when we view them
as parts of a syllogism, we assert that C is not B, because
it is not A,· in other words, that nothing can be B which is
not A, or that every B must be A. YVhereas the premise,
in stating that all A is B, leaves it open as at least a pos-
