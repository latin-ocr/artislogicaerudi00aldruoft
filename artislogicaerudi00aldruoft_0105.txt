and of man to animal, is expressed in the second intention
genus or species. First intentions, as conceptions of things,
are predicable of the individuals conceived under them.
Thus we may say, “Socrates is man, animal, &c.” Second
intentions are not so predicable: we cannot say, ‘⁶ Socrates
is species, genus, &c.” Hence when we are told that a
predicable is commune, univocum, secundae intentionis, it is not
meant that all universale are in themselves second intentions;
but that every predicate vien-ed in relation to its subject may be
comprehended under one of Porphyry's five classes of pre-
dicables; all which are second intentions. So when Genus
is said to be predicable of Species, it is not meant that we can
predicate the one second intention of the other, so as to say,
“ Species is Genus;⁷’ but that the first intention “ animal '' is
predicable of the first intention “man;” the relation of the
one to the other being expressed by the second intentions
“ genus '‘ and ¹⁶ specieS.'‘ For this reason Logic was said to
treat of second intentioris applied tofirst. See Aquinas, Opusc.

The distinction between first and second intentions is
generally considered as of Arabian origin. And this is
perhaps true, as far as regards the assigning of second
intentions as the proper object matter of LogiC. In this
point of view, Avieenna, in the beginning of his Logic, dis-
tinguishes between those essences of things which are in the
things themselves, and those which are in the intellect; and,
in the second chapter of his Metaphysics‚ says, “ Subjectum
Logicae sunt intentiones intellectae secund0‚ quae apponuntur
intentionibus pr'1mo intellectis, secundum hoc quod per eas per-
venitur de cognito ad incognitum.'' But the distinction itself,
and even the name, may be found much earlier. Boethius, in the
beginning oshis commentary on the CategorieS‚ distinguishes,
