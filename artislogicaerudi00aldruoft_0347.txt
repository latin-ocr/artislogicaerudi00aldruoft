the place where they meet is always a single point.⁷'
“Two lines ean intersect each other, and the place
where they intersect is always a single point.”
(These are properties of the point, and assumptions of
the possibility of angles.) “ A straight line may lie in
and form part of a superficies.'’ Definitions xiii, xiv,
xvi, are the only purely verba] ones3 for Definitions x,
xi, xii, and xvii, assume that straight lines ean be drawn
to eomply with certain speoified conditions3 and the
others, being definitions of figures, assume that lines
under specified conditions can enclose a space.

The above remarks will sufficiently shew in what
respeots the attempts of Geometers to dispense with
axioms have failed. They have not been aware that
every synthetioal judgment assumed without demon-
stration is a axiom. They have attempted to deal, not
very sueoessfully, with the expressed axioms of Euolid3
but they have neglected‚ and in their own attempts have
assumed, principles equally axiomatie, though only
understood; and they have not been aware that an
assumption resting on an appeal to the senses or to
the imagination is as much an unproved assumption as
one which appeals to the thought3 for of the one we
ean only say that we are so constituted that we cannot
but perceive it, and of the other, that we are so oon-
stituted that we cannot but think it.

An ingenious and instructive but unsueoessful attempt
of this kind is made in General Thompson’s “ Geometry
without Axioms.” The author every where identifies
intelligible magnitudes with sensible3 and this identifi-
cation gives rise to a multitude of subordinate assump-
tions‚ inadmissible in striot demonstration, but which, if
admissible‚ would be as much axioms as any thing in
Euclid. By identifying intelligible magnitudes with
sensible, it is implied that all the perfeetions which are
