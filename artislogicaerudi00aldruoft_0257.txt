a portion of the attributes which the subject notion
comprehends 3 precisely as does animal, when predicated
of man.

A Lowest Species will be inadmissible, as it implies
a notion so complex as to be incapable of further
accessions. It is true that, in the continual formation of
Species, we may arrive at combinations of attributes not
realized in Nature3 but the classification of things is not
the province of the Logician 3 nor has he a right to con-
clude ὰ priori that the field of physica] research is ex-
hausted, or that notions now regarded as imaginary may
not hereafter be discovered to be real. But whether such
discovery be made or not, it will not affect the relation
of two notions to each other. Logic is concerned only
with the necessary relations of concepts in thought.
Evcry concept, being common to a plurality of objects,
is potentially divisible into lower ones. A logical
lowest species, if such were possible, would be a con-
cept embracing all conceivable attributes not condemned
by the laws of thought as contradictory of each other.
This, as well as its opposite, the logical highest genus,
or notion so simple as to have no distinctive attributes,
are mere imaginary limits, never reached in any process
of actual thought⁵. A material science may have its
highest and lowest classes, the former being the general
class, embracing all the objects whose properties that
science investigates3 the latter the classes at which that
special investigation ends. ’ Ι11 Geometry, for example,
under the summum qenus of magnitudes in space, we find
three ioffimae species of triangles, the equilateral, the
isosceles, and the scalene. The geometrical properties
of the figures are not affected by any further subdivision.
But this limitation ci'annot be acknowledged by the

Logician. He knows nothing of the geometrica] or
