he does so in the teeth of Kant's demonstraffion, that a
criterion of material truth is not only impossible, but
sels-contradictory.v In attempting to enlarge the field
of Logic, he only makes it impossible to assign to it
any definite field whatever. If a single intruder is
admitted from the province of material knowledge, no
barrier can be devised which shall not with equal facility
give access to all.

On this ground objections may be taken against the
view of another eminent English writer on Logic, whose
work has attained to a high and in many respectas a well-
deserved reputation. According to Mr. Mill, Logic may
be defined as “ the science of the operations of the un-
derstanding which are subservient to the estimation of
evidence: both the process itself of proceeding from
known truths to unknown, and all intellectual operations

his treatise on Logic is based on a combination of the
Old and the New Organon 3 and the Baconian rules for
the interrogation and interpretation of nature are eom-
bined with the Aristotelian principles of the syllogism7
as part and parcel of the same science.

This definition appears as much too wide as that of
Archbishop thately is too narrow. The latter is open
to objection‚ because it excludes from the province of
Logic processes of thought dependent upon precisely
the same laws, and subject to the same method of
discovery and criticiffln, as that of reasoning. The
present definitior] is open to objection, because it iu-
cludes within the province of Logic procosscs governed
by different laws, involving f1111d2une11ta.lly different lne-
