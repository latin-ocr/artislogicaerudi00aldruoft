Scholastic
Logic.

xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

Charlemagne and his successors, and was eventually

'applied to all who, whether professedly teaehers or not,

adopted in their writings the method and matter which
finally formed the course of educat-ion in these and similar
establishments. The distinguishing feature of Scholas-
ticism, the union of a theological matter with a dialectical
method‚ is found at least as early as the writings of
Lanfranc in the eleventh century. Commencing from
this point, Scholasticism may be divided into three
periods. 1. Its infancy, extending from the eleventh
to the middle of the thii·teenth century. 2. Its prime,
from the latter period to the middle of the fifteenth.
3. Its decline, extending to the end of the sixteenth
century-¹.

The Logic of the Schoolmen is a phrase frequently
employed, and often very inaccurately, It is incorreet
to apply this name to the various applications of the
syllogistic method‚ in Theology, in Metaphysics, in
PhysicS, or in Psychology. These are merely treatises
on their proper subjects, with a somewhat more osten-
tatious display of logical art than has been usual at
other periods. But the applications of Logic to reason-
ings on this or that branch of materia] science have
nothing in them which is more peculiarly the property
of the Sehoohnen than of any other reasoners. The
Loyica utens is one and the same to all generations of
men3 all who reason soundly, reason consciously or
unconsciously by logical laws3 and the open display of
the instrument in use does not make it a distinct in-
strument from that which others employ in a more
concealcd manner.

A historica] account of the Scholastic Logic ought
therefore to confine itself to commentaries and treatises
