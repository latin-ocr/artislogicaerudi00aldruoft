and superscription on two coins may present no dis-
cernible marks of distinction from each other3 but if on
that account we say that they are thre same, we employ
the word in an equivocal sense, which must be carefully
distinguished from that in which we say that both are
struck from the same die. In the latter sense, the
attributes forming the humanity of Socrates are not the
same with those forming the humanity of Plato; though
the common notion man embraces both, and though, by
availing ourselves of an ambiguity of language, we say
that both are of the same species.

General notions thus framed by the mind, when
expressed in language, form common terms. And the
various attributes comprehendedk in every such notion
are its logical essence¹. By this we do not mean any
thing necessary to the physica] existence of an object3
but merely that, as general notions are formed from
the observation of similar attributes in individuals, every
individual must possess such attributes, if it is to be
included under the extension of the notion and called

Heads of Predicables,” Ι inadvertently adopted Mr. Mffl's expressions of
connotation and detaeonzeiorz, to distinguish between the attributes contained
in a complex nofflon, and the subjects of which it is predicated, The
distinction I still regard as most important, and one that is not perhaps
sufficiently marked in modern language; but further study of the scholastic
phraseology has led me to regard Mr. Mill's language as too wide a
departure from the original use of the ternas. For this reason Ι have
preferred the expressions comprehensiva and Extensimz, as better sanc-
tioned by Logical authon‘ty. Cf. Port Royal Logic, P. I. chap. 6. “ J 'appelle

Connotation, see p. 163 note g.

1 This is the Nominal Essence of Locke, which corresponds to the
Logical Essence of other phihsophers, though variously explained according
to the different Metaphysical theories. The term Reae Essence is used
by the same philosopher to denote that generally unknown constitution of
individual thinys on which their sensible properties depend-
