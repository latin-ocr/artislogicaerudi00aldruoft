of knowledge. Hence the laws of physical causation
are introduced without modification into the moral and
intellectual world3 and, instead of an ideal science of
-man as he ought to think or act, we are presented with
an empirica] science of the observed relations between
thoughts or actions as they actually take place. Thus in
the place of a system of Ethics based upon the theory of
a free will as it ought to be determined by moral obli-
gations, is substituted Ethology, or the science of the
actual phenomena of habits formed by a necessary agent
under the laws of an invariable causationf. And in con-
sistency‚ as a part of the same system, we ought also to
be presented with an ὰ posteriori science of Geometry,
based upon the measurement of figured bodies as
actually found in nature. This alone is needed to
furnish the consummation‚ and at the same tinne the
reductio acl absurdum, of the whole system g.

On the above grounds, we are justified in rejecting
Mr. Mill's definition of Logic as too wide for scientific
accuracy‚ as that of Archbishop thately is too narrow

f The reader need scarcely be remhrded, that this is Mr. Mill's actim]
conception of Ethology as the Exact Science of Human Nature. See his
Logic, B. VI. Chap. V.

g This indeed is almost implied in the conception os M. Comte‚ who
regards it as the principal office of Matheinatics to furnish a substitute
for the measuring rod. To quote his own words. “ Nous devons regarder
comme suffisamnient constatee l’impossibilite de determina, en les me-
surant directement, la plupart des grandeurs que nous desimus connaitre.
C'est ce fait general qui necessite la formation dela science mathemau'que.

the language of Plato, Rep. vii. p. 527. Λέγουσι μέν που μάλα γελοίως τε
