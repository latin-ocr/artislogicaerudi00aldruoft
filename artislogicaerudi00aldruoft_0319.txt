may thus be hypothetically combined into⁴ a single
truth3 and this combination cannot be reduced into
categorica] foring. The Hypothetical Syllogism, in like
γ manner, is a form of reasoning distinct from the Cate-
gorieal and not reducible to it, being based on a different
law ofthought, namely, the Logical Principle of Sufficient
Reason, a ratione ad intimatum, α neyatione rationati ad
negationem rationis valet eonseqaentiah.

Of this principle, as applied to judgments, Ι have
elsewhere remarked, that it is not a law of thought, but
only a statement of the necessity of some law or otheri.
As applied to syllogisms, it has the same character. It
states, generally, that whenever a condition, whether
material cause of a fact or formal reason of a conclusion,
exists, the conditioned fact or conclusion exists also.
Thus viewed, it is not the law of any distinct reasoning
process, but a statement of the conditions in which laws
of nature or of thought are operative. XVhen a material
cause exists, its material effect follows, and the pheno-
menon indicates a law of nature: when a logical premise
is given, its logical conclusion follows, and the result
indicates a law of thought. What law, must in each
case be determined by the particular features of the
phenomenon οι· reasoning in question, but a statement
of this kind is distinguished from laws of thought,
properly so called, by the fact, that it cannot be ex-
pressed in a symbolical form: we require the introduction
of a definite notion, Came, Reason, Conditimz, or some·
thing of the kind, which is a special object of thought,
not the general representative of all objects whatever.
The principle in question is thus only a statement of
