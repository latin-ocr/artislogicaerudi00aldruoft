ΟΝ THE HYPOTHETICAL SYLLOGISM.

THAT the ‹rumoyxo-twt ἐξ ὑποθέσεως of Aristotle are not
identical with those which, sinc-e the time of Theophrastus
and Eudemus, have been received in Logie as Hypothe-
tica] Syllogiffins, is now generally admitteda. The word
Hypotlzetieal is never by Aristotle opposed to Cate-
ιᾳονὶσαῖ, but to ostensive (851nrax0'5b); and he remarks that
the Sylloyisz‘ie portion of the reasoning iu Hypothetical
Syllogisms is ostensive, and requires no reduction3 but
that the determination of the original question is not
effected by Syllogism at all, and cannot be exhibited in
Syllogistie form. The meaning of this may be clearly
explained by examples.

Of the Hypothetieal Syllogism, two principa] kinds are
mentioned by Aristotle. One is the ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς τὸ ἀδύνατονε
the other is a Syllogism ofwhieh the conclusiveness depends
entirely on agreement between two contending parties,
and which is therefore chiefly serviceable in dialectie
disputat-ion. The latter may be exhibited as follows.

The original question being to prove that some A is
not B; the contending parties agree to the hypothesis,
that if some A is not O, it is not Β. The reasoning
proceeds thus:

No X is C 3
All X iS A; (συλλογισμὸς ἐξ ὑποθέσεως.)
Therefore‚ Some A is not C.

ὃ ἲΥε must except M. St. Hilaire, who professes to discover the ordinary
Hypotheticals in Anal. Prior. i. 44. 1. But the text of Aristotle will hardly
wari-ant the assei-tion. Cf. Sir W. Hamiston, Discussions, p. 152, md Ed.)
Leclures οη Loyic, ii. p. 387. In the latter place, Sir W. Hamilton notices
that Alis-totle has himself described the process of rcasoning commonly
called hypothetical, but denies it to be a syllogism. See Anal. Pr. i. 32. 7.
