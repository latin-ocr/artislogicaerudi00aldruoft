It may be true that the image which gives rise to the
intuitive perception of the axiom, is not consciously
contemplated as more perfect than the corresponding
figure as seen in a body3 but this does not prove that
the axiom is really generalized fron] the lattere. The
inadequacy of sensible magnitudes for mathematica]
certainty does not arise from that of which we are
immediately consciens, but from that of which we are
not. The straight line as perceived is a quality of body3
the straight line as imagined is a modification of space.
The portions of the two actually presented at any time
may not apparently differ from each other; but our
empirical knowledge or ignorance of body may suggest
actual or possible variations not perceived in the in-
tuition3 for the qualities of body have an objective
existence independently of our perception, and therefore
may or may not be adequately perceived at any one
time. We see, for example, that a line running along
the earth's surface is apparently straight, but we know
that it is in reality an arc of the earth’s curvature, and
might be seen to be so in another position or with more
acute organs. But the straight line in space exists only
as imagined, and is imagined only as mathematically
exact. The intuition‚ therefore, is adequate and valid
for any extent of space, and in any portion. The
apparent straightness of the visible line is the result of
an imperfection in our bodily organs3 and with more
acute senses wc might perceivc its deviation. The
presented straightness of the imaginary line results from
the exactness of our constructive power 3 and a superior

‘³ See St. Augustine, consess. x. c. 12. “Vidi lineas fabrorum, vel
etiam tenuissimas, sicut filum araneae3 scd inae alim sunt, non sunt
inmginos earum quas mihi nuntiavit earnis oculus.”
