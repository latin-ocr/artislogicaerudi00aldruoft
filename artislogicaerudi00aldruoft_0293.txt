ΟΝ THE ENTHYMEME.

THE Enthymeme is defined by Aristotle, συλλογισμὸς
[ἀτελὴς] ἐξ εἰκότων ’ὴ σημείων. The word ἀτελὴς is now
universally admitted to be spurious3 and that upon
abundantly sufficient evidence, both externa] and in-
ternal ὃ. Externally‚ it is not countenanced by the best
MSS. Internally, it is inconsistent with the ordinary
language of Aristotle3 with whom the imperfect Sylloyism
signifies‚ not a Syllogism with one portion suppressed‚
but a Syllogism in the second or third figure, which is
not immediately evident by the dictum de omni et nullo.
The word is an interpolation, anda clumsy one, designed
to accommodate Aristotle's definition to subsequent views
of the nature of the Enfflymeme, and made by a scribe
not particularly well versed in Aristotelian phraseology.

The εἰκὸς and σημεῖον themselves are Propositionsb3 the
former stating a yeneral probability, the latter a fact,
which is known to be an indication, more or less certain,
of the truth of some further statement, whether of a single
fact or of a general belief. The former is a proposition
nearly, though not quite, universal,· as, “ Most men who

however, the terms εἰκός, σημεῖον, τεκμήριον, are often used for the Enthy-
memes drawn from each. The εἰκὸς is clearly regarded by Aristotle as a
qeneral proposition, employed as a premise. In the Rhetorie, i. 2. 15. he
describes it as having the same relation to its conclusion as an universal
to a particular. In another sense, any proposition may be called probable,
which can as α conclusion be supported upon (morally) reasonable grounds ;
in which sense Anaximenes, or whoever was the Author of the Rhetorica
ad Alea-andrum. defines the εἰκός. (ch. 8. 4.)
