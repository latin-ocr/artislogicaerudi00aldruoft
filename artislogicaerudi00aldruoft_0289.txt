Universa] Propositions. It will be sufficient, however, for
my present purpose to observe that, unless the establish=
ment of an Universal Proposition requires an explicit
and conscious examination of every existing and also of
every possible particular instance, no charge of Petitio
Principii, or even of vain repetition, can be maintained
against the Syllogism, Those who maintain the ante-
cedent, abandon themselves to an absolute scepticismk3
and against such, no defence of any source of human
knowledge can 01· need be attempted.

With regard to the syllogism of proof, we may examine
the question a little more closely. The Petitio Principii
is a material, not a formal fallacy, and consists in
assuming, in demonstration, a non-axiomatic principle
as axiomatic‚ or in dialectic disputation, a non-probable
principle as p1·obable¹. It does not affect the form of
the reasoning3 but depends on the selection of premises,
when the syllogism is employed for the particular
purpose of proof, demonstrative or dialectic. Those
are guilty of it who do not adopt such premises as the
laws of the two processes require, in the one case,
propositions axiomatic or deducible from axioms, in the
other, probable statementS, sanctioned by the general
opinion of mankind or the authority of eminent persons.

In reading Aristotle’s account of this fallacy, it is
evident that the whole point of the matter lies in the word
αἰτεῖσθαι, Οι· λαμβάνειν5 and that the question to be asked
is, not whether the premises virtually contain the con-

k Sed ea ratione prorsus evertuntur scientiae‚ et Sceptici vicere. Nam
nunquam constitui possunt ea ratione propositiones perfecte universales3
quia inductione nunquam certus es, omnia individua a te tentata esse3 sed
semper intra hanc propositionem subsistes, omnia illa, quae expertus sum,
sunt talia 3 quum vera non possit esse ulla ratio universalis, semper
manebit possibile, innumera, quae tu non sis expertus, esse diversa.”
Leibnitz, de Stylo Nizolii. ’
