APPENDIX. 193

This method was a favourite with Plato: it was rejected
as useless by Speusippusi. Aristotle adopts an inter-
mediate course, limiting, however, its utility chiefly to
two points,—the right arrangement of the several parts
of the Definition, and the security that nothing essential
is omitted. It would thus seem to be useful, not so
much for discovering] Definitions as for testiny them³3
and even in this respect will be applicable only to one
class of Definitions, that of Substances by genus and
differentiae.

For discovery, the second method is employed. This
is commonly called the Inductive Method; a name, how-
ever, not sanctioned by Aristotle himselfk. It consists in
examining the several individuals of which the term to
be defined is predicable, and observing what they have
in common. If we cau obtain one common notion, this
is the Definition sought, if not, the object of inquiry is
not one but many. This method is equally applicable
to Substances and to Attributes, though Aristotle only
gives an example of the latter,—the definition of mag-
nanimity, gained by examining into the actions of dif-
ferent magnanimous persons.

Another important remark of Aristotle’s is, that although,
as we have already seen, demonstration, in certain cases,
must always precede definition, yet no definition, ‘as
such, can be proved. This he maintains at some length
(against Xenocrates¹), in Anal. Post. i. 4. and shews that

J‘ This is perhaps marked by Aristotle's own language. In reference to
the One method, he uses κατασκευάζειν; to the other, ζητεῖν.

¹³ Aristotle does not give any name to the process: by his Commentators
it has been variously denominated the method of Resolution‚ of Com-
position, of Induction. See Sir W. Hamilton, Discussions, p. 173. Zabarella,
Logia, p. 1212. Pacius on Anal. Post. ii. 13. 21.
