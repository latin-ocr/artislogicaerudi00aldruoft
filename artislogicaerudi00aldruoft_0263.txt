APPENDIX. 179

The omission, therefore, in the Aristotelian list, os
separate heads of classification for mental stateS, cannot
be charged as a defect in this point of view, so long as
mind and its various states (whatever may be their dif—
ference in other respects) are represented by the same
verbal forms as substances and attributes. And accord-
ingly we find various mental states, faculties, passions,
habits, and dispositionS, classified together with corre-
sponding affections of body, under the head of qualitiesk.
A more valid objection in a grammatica] point of view
would be, that qualities in their abstract form are ex-
pressed by nouns substantive, and should therefore be
classed under the category of substance. This objection
would be tenable in relation to the distinctions of modern
Grammar. But Aristotle appears to have limited the
substantive word to terms expressive of the πρῶται oderim,
or individual substances, and the δεύτεραι οὐσίαι, or their
several genera and species. The latter denote properly
the category of substance, or substance considered as
one of the possible predicates of a proposition. words
denoting individua] substances, being subjects only in
the proposition, do not properly indicate a categoryl.

In reference, therefore, to the treatise of the same
name, we might fairly describe the Aristotelian Categories
as an enumeration of the different grammatica] forms of
the possible predicates of a proposition, viewed in relation
to the first substance as a subject. And this view is not
materially departed from in the other writin gs of Aristotle„
The passage quoted from the Topics, indeed, only con-
tinues the same view, stating that those predicates, which
