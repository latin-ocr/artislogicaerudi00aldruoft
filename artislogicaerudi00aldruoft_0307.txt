APPENDIX. 223

to reduce Induction to Syllogism, in the strict sense
of the term, must commence by inverting the whole
operati0n3 stating as a preliminary assumption that
which is really the conclusion of the Inductive process.
It moreover leaves us no alternative between converting
mere empirical judgments into self-evident axioms, or
destroying the whole foundation of reasoning, by com-
mencing with a Syllogism whose premises themselves
must be proved by another Syllogism‚ and so on ad
infinitum.

The Aristotelian Induction proper has been described
as an analytical, its counterpart, Syllogism‚ as a Syn-
thetz'cal process3 and the two have respectively been
identified with the λόγοι ἐπὶ τὰς ἀρχάς and ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρχῶν
of Aristotleh. And this is in one sense correct, though,
according to a various notion of whole and part, the
terms Analysis and Synthesis have perpetually been
interchanged with each other. According as we look to
the comprehensim, or to the extension of the notions‚ we
may regard the Genus as a partos the Species, or the
Species as a part of the Genus. Hence the notions of
Synthesis and Analysis‚ of the composition of parts into
a whole, and the resolution of a whole into parts, will,
as we adopt the one or the other point of view, be
inverted. We have previously spoken of Induction as
an infel-enee from the constituting parts to the con⁶
stituted whole. In this respect it is synthetz‘cal, the parts
and whole being viewed in their loyical οι· extensional
relation. In the same point of view, the Platonic
method of division is sometimes called analytieali. On
the other hand, in the ordinary modern use of the terius,
Induction is analytical, adopting the metaphysical relation
