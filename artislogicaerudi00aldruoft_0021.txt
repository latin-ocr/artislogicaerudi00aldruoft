or of philosophers. The third are only a special appli-
cation of probablc reasonings to expose the ignorance
of pretenders in seienoer. The fourth are fallacious
reasonings, from apparent but not real probabilities. In
a subseqnent passage, he distinguishes between ἐριστικοί
and σοφιστικοί ; the former being such as employ fallacy

unjust to the ancient dialectie, when he describes it as a sophistical art of

giving illusion the appearance of truth. The tentative use of dialectie very
nearly corresponded with his own.
