Nam 1. sit vera Ed, puta Nullum A est B: Ergo

b Per aeciclens; so called because it is not a conversion
of the universal per se, but by reason of its containing the
particular. For the proposition “ Some B is Α,” is primarily
the converse of “ Some A Is B,⁷' secondarily of “All A is B.''
See Boethius, de Syll. Cat. p. 589.

0 A st O, per contra ‚· sicfit conversio tota.

Conversion by contraposiffion, which is not employed
by Aristotle‚ is given by Boethius in his first book, De
Sylloqismo Categsorico. He is followed by Petrus Hispanus,
who first gives the mnemonic, as above. It should be oba
served, that the old Logicians, following Boethius, main-
tain‚ that in conversion by contraposition, as well as in
the others, the quality should remain unchanged. Con-
sequently the converse of “ ΑΙ] A is B'' is “All not B is
not Α,” and of “Some A is not B‚'’ “Some not B is not
not A.” It is simpler, however, to convert A into E and O
into I, (“ No not B is A;‘’ “Some not B is Α,”) as is done by
Wallis and Abp. Whately; and before Boethius by Apuleius
and Capella, who notice the conversion, but do not give it a
name. The principle of this conversion may be found in
Aristotle, Top. ii. 8. 1. though he does not employ it for
logical purposesj

d Sit vera E. This is the proof given by Theophrastus
and Eudemus. (Alexander, Scholia, p. 148. b. 29.) Aristotle
proves it by the method called ἕκθεσις, i. e. by the e.z·]zibiti0n
of an individua] instance, (ἐκτιθέναι exponere sensui ,· whence a
syllogism with singular premises is called sylloyismus escpo-
sitorc'us.) Thus, No A is B, therefore No B is A, for if not,
Some individual B, say C, is A. Then C is both A and B,
