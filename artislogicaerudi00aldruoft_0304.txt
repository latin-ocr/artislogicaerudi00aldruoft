9:20 APPENDIX.

an universal conclusion is logically drawn in this form,
which is not valid in the third figure of Syllogism.

We see then, that in the Inductive process the Copula
is ambiguous, expressing in the major promise and in
the conclusion, the relation of a contained part to a con-
taining whole3 in the minor premise, that of constituting
parts to a constituted whole. This ambiguity has been
remarked as a deficiency in technical language03 but
there is no term sufficiently naturalized in Logic to serve
as a substitute to express the latter relation.

On Induction, as exhibited above, it may be remarked,

I. That the distinction between a perfect and an im-
perfect Induction is extralogical. Logic recognises no
inference that is not necessitated by the Laws of Thought:
and therefore it must be presumed that the Induction is
perfect, i. e. that the Individuals mentioned are in reality
the whole constituents of the species, before the Inductive
Inference can come in any way within the province of
the Logician. To inquire what is the warrant for this
presumption3 to ask what amount of observation will
warrant us iu assuming X, Y, and Z, to be all the
members of the class A3 is like asking in syllogistic
reasoniug, how do we know that the premises are true?
undoubtedly a most important question, but not to
be answered by Logic. So also any comproniise with
material probability, any statement of the individuals
as samples or adequate representatives of their class ⁰,
is a surrender of the essentia] principle of Logieal
Rcasoning: the parts are absolutely the wholc; or the
inference is, logically speaking, worthless.

It is manifest, however, that the Induction may be
