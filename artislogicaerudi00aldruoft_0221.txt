servus Ergo est cervus; Est ara Ergo est hara.
Est malum (an apple) Ergo malum (an evil).
Venatur lepores Ergo et lepores3 quibus qui falli

arripitur: idque vel Grammatieeg, ut Musa est

ἕ Grammatice, i. e. infel-ring that Poeta is of the feminine
gender, because the majority of words with the same termi-
nation are so. Βορέαο, inferring that videre belongs to the
category of ποιεῖν, because most infinitive moods of this form
are included under it. Thus viewed, it may be classed as in
dictione, because the rules of gender and conjugation are dif—
ferent in different languages.

But the more common form in which this Fallacy would be
stated is that of an induction, or rather a number of examples,
after the manner of Socrates. Indeed, this very sophism is
put into the mouth of Socrates by Aristophanes, Nubes,
681 sqq. Stated in this form, the logical inconsequence is
obvious3 as also if it is reduced to syllogism. “Such and
such words are feminine; Musa resembles such and such
words.'' Here there is no middle term. This ambiguity is
sometimes called multiplex phantasticwn. Cf. Petr. Hisp.
Summ. Log. Tract. vi. “ Est autem multiplex phantasticum,
quando aliqua dictio significat unum et videtur significare
aliud, propter similitudinem quam habet in parte eum alia
dictione: ut videre significat passionem, et videtur significare
actionem, propter hoc quod est simile huic verbo, affere.'' In
this form, it would seem more naturally to belong to the class
extra dictionem.

In Rhet. ii. 24. 2. Aristotle gives another form of this
Fallacy; viz. when a series of detached propositions are so
enunciated as to appear logically connected, not being really

so. See also Soph. Elench2 15. 5.
