188 APPENDIX.

There is also no warrant in Aristotle for limiting the
means by which Nomina] Definition may be effeeted3
as is done by those Logieians who specify synonyms and
etymologies. The latter met-hod indeed seems to have
trespassed on the domain of Logic from that of Rhetoric.
Nor has it the slightest connection with the former, save
by an ambiguity of language. The etymology will in nine
cases out of ten declare, not the present meaning of the
word, but either one that has become obsolete, or some
secondary notion, which may account for the imposition
of the name, but which at no time formed, strictly speak-
ing, any part of its signification. This holds equally of
real objects and imaginary. It is only by an equivocation
that “bull-piereer” can be assigned as the meaniny of
‘⁶ centaur,’⁷ or the notions of a swine and a quickset
fence be combined into that of ‘⁶ hedgehog.⁷⁷

Definition by synonym, on the other hand, may be one
of the means of explaining the signification of a name3
though relatively only, and froin the accidental circum-
stance of one word being more familiar to the hearer
than another3 in which respect all translations from one
language into another are equally nomina] definitions.
It is not, however, specially mentioned by Aristonea.
As a real definition it is obviously inadmissible, as it
neither assigns the cause of a phenomenon nor developes
the contents of a notion.

The above data will also furnish us with an answer to
a question, which, latterly at least, has been a sore puzzle
to the tiro in Logic. What are the limits of Definition?
If all real Definition must be by Genus and Differentia,
