ΟΝ MATERIAL AND FORMAL CONSEQUENCE.

A MATERIAL CONSEQUENCE is defined by Aldrich to be
one in which the conclusion follows from the premises
solely by the force of the terms. This in fact meanS,
from some understood Proposition or Propositions, con-
necting the terms, by the addition of which the mind is
enabled to reduce the Consequence to logical form. This
is easily seen, both in Aldrich's example, “Homo est
animal, Ergo est vivens,'' and in the rather more corn-
plicated instance given by Sanderson, “ Socrates est
risibilis, ergo, Aliquis homo est rationalis.’' The latter,
when the necessary conditions are supplied, is expanded
into two syllogisms.

Omne risibile est rationale ;
Socrates est risibilis,

Erg0‚ Socrates est rationalis.
Socrates est horno,

Ergo, Aliquis homo est rationalis.

The failure therefore of a Materia] Consequence takes
place when no such connexion exists between the ternis
as will warrant us in supplying the premises required:
i. e. when one or more of the premises so supplied would
be false. But to determine this point is obviously
beyond the province of the Logician. For this reason,
Materia] Consequence is rightly excluded from Logic.
Moreover, even where true premises can be added,
and the Consequence legitimately deduced, we cannot,
except from knowledge of the matter, determine into

what form the reasoning will naturally fall. In some

cases⁹ asin the example above quoted from Sanderson,
