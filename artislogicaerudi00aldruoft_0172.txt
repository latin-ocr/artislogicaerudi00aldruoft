Quaest. xxii. sqq. Occam, Logica‚ p. iii. cap. 6. Of these in-
direct moods‚ five were admitted in the first figure, two in
the second, (by converting the conclusions of Cesare and
Camestres‚) three in the third, (by converting the conclusions
of Darapti, Disamis, and Datisi.) Cf. Anal. Pr. i. 7. ii. ⁴1. Of
these, the five in the first figure are the most important, being
sometimes regarded as a fourth figure. See p. 77, note x.
The perfect and imperfect moods of Aristotle are sometimes
called immediate and mediate. Of. Aquinas, Op. xlviii. cap. l.
Occam, Log. p. iii. cap. 2. Boethius calls them imlemoozstrable
and alenzonstrahle.

‘¹ [inductio. The vulue of Reduction in Logic will depend
on the principle adopted as the basis of the syllogism. In
the systems of Aristotle and Kant, whose principles are im-
mediately applicable only to the first figure, reduction is
necessary. In the system of Lamhert, in which each figure
rests on a separate axiom, reduction is impossible: the
process being then the destruction of one distinct reasoning‚
und the substitution of another. By reducing the laws of
thought to their simplest form, in which they arc applicable
10 all syllogisms (lirectly, reduction is superfluous.
