existens excidit, vel in quo non erat. Sed neutrum
horum; Ergo non omnino. Diodori argumento
breviter et perspicue respondet Gassendus, Quod
movetur moveri a loeo in quo erat, per locum in
quo est (sive quem pertransit), acl locum in quo
nondum est, sed futurum esth.

3. RECIPROCUM vocat Argumentum Gellius, quod

Graece dicitur Ἀντιο-τρέφον : cui illustrando con-
ficta est Fabula quae Graecorum vanitatem olet.
Narrant enim inter Protagoram et Euathlum, vel
(ut facetiae locus sit) inter Coracem et Tisiam⁰
convenisse, ut hunc ille Dialecticam doceret;
idque hac lege, ut dimidium mercedis statim ac-

b The true solution os the sophism of Diodorus is, that the
disjunctive premise is false. “The place where a body is,'⁷
is contradictory of “the place where a body is not;'’ as
“Englishmen'' is contradictory of “not-Englislimen;” but
“ moving in the place where it is‚'' is no more contradictory
of “moving in the place where it is not‚⁷' than “an army com-
posed of Englishmen” is contradictory of “an army composed
of not-Englishmen.” As it would be false to say, “Every army
must be composed of Englishmen or not-Englishmen,” to the
exclusion of the third possibility of a mixed force; so it is
salse to say, ‘⁴ Every body must move in the place where it
is, or in the place where it is not‚'' to the exclusion of the
third possibility of moving partly in the one and partly in
the other. This solution is substantially given by Hobbes,
