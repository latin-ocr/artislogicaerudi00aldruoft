216 APPEND1X.

or Rhetorical reasonings are founded 011 τόποι; the
others on the peculial· principles of that Science or Art
to which they belongk.

This passage is generally found puzzling to a beginner
on two accounts. Firstly, he is apt to fancy Dialectic
synonymous with Logic, and to confound it with the
formal Science os that name3 an error which the Com-
mentary most likely to fall in his way is not unlikely
to confirm. Secondly‚ having previously seen the Enthy-
meme defined as the Rhetorica] Syllogism3 there seems
some inconsistency in the Subsequent observation, that
some Enthymeines are Rhetorical, others not so.

In explanation it may be observed: First, that
Dialectic and Rhetoric are not formal Sciences, but
material Arts. Their Logic is not a Loyica docens,
treating of the general form of Reasoning, but a Loyica
utem, treating of Reasoning as applied to a particular
matter. That matter is furnished by the τόποι. Rhetoric
and Dialectic do not merely lay down the forn] in which
their reasonings ought to proceed, but likewise provide
certain general principles of probability, froin which the
matter of their major premises is to be drawn. These
τόποι οι· connnon-plaoes hold the same position in the
Dialectic Syllogism, as the most universal kind of
axioins in the Demonstrative. They are not gained by
exclusive observation of any one particular class of
objects belonging to this or that art or faculty, but are
indifferently applicable to all. Such is the example
quoted by Aristotle as ὁ τοῦ μᾶλλον καὶ ἧττον τόπος. Of
this in the Topics he gives four cases, of which the
following may bo taken as a specimen. “If the more
likely assertion on any subject be untrue, the less likely
is probably untrne likewiso.'' Α general maxim of this
