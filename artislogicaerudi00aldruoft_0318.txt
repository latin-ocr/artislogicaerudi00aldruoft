contradictor-y propositions as alternatives, one of them
being disproved by a prosyllogism.

Either Some A is not B, or All A is B ; in which latter case
All O is A;
Therefore, All G is Β.

This conclusion being manifestly false, we have no
choice but to admit the other alternative. The pro-
syllogism in this case, as in the former, may be omitted,
if the falsehood of the alternative is evident without it.
We have thus the Disjunctive Syllogism.

We may agree therefore with M. St. Hilaire thus far,
that, though the form of the Hypothetical Syllogism is not
explicitly exhibited in the extant writings of Aristotle,
we have nevertheless the data from which it needs but
one step to develope it. Whether that step was taken
by Aristotle himself in a lost work, or supplied by his
disciples, is a point of little consequence3 though
externa] testimony is decidedly in favour of the latter
supposition.

Far more important, in a logical point of view, is the
inquiry whether the hypothetical syllogism, by whom-
soever analysed, is a legitimate addition to the forms
of reasoning acknowledged in Aristotle’s Organon3 and
consequently, whether its omission can fairly be cen-
sured as a deficiency in that treatise. On this question,
I find myself compelled to hold an opinion different
from that of the Logicians whose views have been mainly
followed in the present work.

By Kant and his followers, the Hypothctical Pro-
position is described as representing a form of judgment
essentially distinct from the Gategorical 3 the latter being
thoroughly assertorial, the former problematical in its
constituent parts, assertorial only as regards the relation
between them. Two judgments, each in itself salse,
