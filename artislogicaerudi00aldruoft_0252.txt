the contrary, have no essence, as they have no general
notion belonging to them, but are mere arbitrary marks
imposed for the purpose of distinguishing individuals
from each other.

But though our earliest complex notions may have
been gained from real objects, there is no reason why
such notions alone should be admitted in a theory of
Predication. Such a theory only distinguishes the several
relations which the subject and predicate of a proposition
may bear to each other. With the objective existence of
things corresponding to our general notions, we have for
the present no concern. whatever theory may be adopted
as to the origin of our ideas, there can be no doubt that
we have the power os forming combinations in the mind,
which have not been observed to exist in naturem. And
the relation of subject and predicate in propositions into
which such notions enter, may be identified with some of
the relations of other notionS.

In constructing or explaining a theory of Predication
in conformity with these views, there is one ambiguity
which it is not possible to avoid, without a coinage of
new terms. The distinctions of Genus and Differentia
must be gained by comparing two terms not predicable
of each other. Compare, for example, Man with Brute,
the common Genus will be Animal, the respective Diffe-
rentiae, Rational and Irrational. But there is no absolute
Genus or Differentia, and frequently, while the whole
comprehension of the notion remains the same, the Genus
and Differentia may change places, according as it is
compared with this or that other notion. In the com-
parison, for example, of a plane triangle with a paral-
lelogram, “ rectilinea] figure” is its common, “having
three sides'' its distinctive part. But compare a plane
