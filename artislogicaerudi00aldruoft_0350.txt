may be transported by the same intuition from one
position in space to another, and all their constituent
attributes with them3 for they eontain no attribute
which is not presented in the image. But the empirical
qualities of a hard body cannot be constructed a priori
in a pure intuition3 and-tangibility, which the author
adopts as the test of corporeity, cannot be conveyed into
the mental image by the construction, nor conceived to
exist, so long as it is transferred from one place to
another solely by the imagination. If Ι draw two
triangles upon paper, I can only shew their coincidence
as bodies by cutting one out and placing it on the other.
Thus the statements of Geometry are reduced to empirical
truths dependent on actual measurement3 a method quite
as applicable ,to theorems as to axioms, and which, con-
sistently carried out, would dispense with demonstration
altogether. For if Ι may prove by measurement that
magnitudes which are eqnal to the same are equal to
each other, I may apply the same test with equal direct-
ness to shew that the angles of a triangle are equal to
two right angles,

Another work, nominally of a similar character to that
of Genera] Thompson, but differing considerably in its
method and actual results, was published in 1856, by
Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood, under the title of “the
Geometry of the three first Books of Euclid by direct
proof from Definitions alone.” The opposition, how-
ever, between the principles of Mr. Wedgwood's treatise
and those maintained in the preceding remarks is more
verbal than real. According to the view of Kant, which
has been adopted iu the preceding remarks, the science
of Geometry is founded on the successive synthesis of
the productive imagination in the generatim] of forms or
magnitudes in space; and its axioms express those con-
‹litions of the sensible intuition (ι priori, under which
