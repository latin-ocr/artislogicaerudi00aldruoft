the sun's light is intercepted by the earth. that is
an eclipse? An intercepting of the sun's light from the
moon by the earth. Thunder in the same way is defined,
ἁπόσ-βεσις πυρὸς ἐν νέφει, the answer to the question διαὶ τί
βξοντᾷς being διὰ τὸ ἀποσβέννυσθαι τὸ πῦρ ἐν τῷ νέφει.

Τ1115 kind of definition, as has been observed, differs
from a demonstration in the position (θέσις) of its
termsJ'; for it has the same terms (ἔκλειψις, ἀντίφραξις,
σελήνῃ-βροντή, ἂπόσβεσις πυρός, νέφος,) but not in the same
order, and with some variety of grammatica] form (mdo-15¹¹).

The Definition, then, of an Attribute is to be found in
its Cause. But the Aristotelian Philosophy recognises
four Causes, and sometimes more than one of these is
concerned in the production of the same effect. Which
of these is to be taken as the Definition? In Anal. Post.
ii. 11. Aristotle shews that any one of the four may be
used as a middle term in demonstrati0n3 but it by no
means follows that each may be a Definition of the major
term. On this point, Aristotle's opinion is not decidedly

“ Omne corpus illuminatum ab alio, inter quod et corpus illuminans opacum
corpus sic interponitur, ut umbra opaci corporis operiat et comprehendat
corpus illuminatum, eclipsatur seu privatur suo lumine.’'

J' The Definition is by some given as “ an obscuration of light in the
moon, caused by the interposition of the earth.” But in this case, the
major term of the Demonstrative Syllogism is not“eclipsed‚'' but “ob-
scured.’' If these two terms are synonymouS‚ the Definition is merely
nominal, and the latter part superfluous; if not, we do not define the
attribute demonstrated (obscuration), but another (eclipse)‚ contained under
it as species under genus. I interpret Aristotle’s words as referring to the
complex form os the Definition, as given in question and answer, or in a
proposition—vi ἐστιν ἔκλειψις ; ἀντίφραξις ὑπὸγῆς-ἡ ἔκλειψίς ἐστιν ἀντίφραξις
ὑπὸ γῆς, So the third form of Definition mentioned An. Pr. ii. 10. resembles
the conclusion of a Demonstration, as containing, in the same form, only
the major and minor terms, (βροντή, νέφος) ἡ βροντή ἐστι ψόφος ἐν νέφει.
Aristotle’s text is not decisive, the one view being rather supported by
ch. S. the other by ch. 10. The question is by no means unimportant3 the
attempt to reduce these Definitions to a pseudo-Genus and Differentia has
sostei-ed a grave error, which will bc noticed hereafter.

¹< Pacius and Waitz consider πτῶσις and θέσις to be synonymous.
