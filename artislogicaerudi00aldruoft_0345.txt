APPENDIX. 261

Some valuable hints on this point may be gathered
from a very able and interesting paper by Professor De
Morgan, printed in the Compam'on to the Almanac for
1849. The following extracts indicate a principle which
might be pursued to further results.

“Book I. Definitimw. Of these, iii, vi, xiii, are obvious
statements, but not definitions of vvords3 viii, xxvi, xxxi
to xxxiv, are never subsequently used, xviii, if semicircle
have its etymological meaning, as seems the intention,
is a theorem, which ought to be iii. 1. The remaining
definitions are of two kinds: first, those which do not
explain their terms, but demand a notion already existing
in the student's mind3 they are i, ii, iv, v, vii, ix: secondly,
purely verba] definitions3 they are x, xi, xii, xiv to xvii,
xix to xxx, and xxxv, Insist on angle as a maym'tude‚·
on the comparison of angles as to greater, equal, or less,
by superpositi0n3 on the rights of angles equal to and
greater than two right angles. The angle made by a
straight line with its own continuation is a definite
angular magnitude, and its half is the best definition
of a right angle. lt is to be regretted that there is no
single phrase for ‘⁶ two right angles„

“Postulate and aaeioms: In Euclid, postulates and
common n-otz'ons. All Geometrical demands are postulate-s·
in Euclid3 lais axioms or common notions are in every
instance notions common to all kinds of magnitude as
well as space magnitudes. Restore this: that is, let
the postulates be, Simson's postulates, and axioms, x, xi,
xii3 but instead of xi, substitute “if two right lines
coincide in two pointS, they coincide when produced,”
as more sels-evident.' From this it is seen that the
doubles of all right angles are equal, and thence that
all right angles are equal; and this should come between
I. 1⁴2. and I. 13. as a proof of the theorem, “all right
angles are equal.'' For xii. substitute “two lines which
