species, or a combination of all conceivable compatible
attributes, is essentially indistinct3 for the number of
such attributes is indefinite, and, to go through them
in thought, enumerating and distinguishing one from
another, would require an infinite grasp of mind, and an
infinite length of time, for its accomplishment.

Another class of notions may be specified as materially
inconceivable3 those, namely, which, though presenting
no logical contradiction, contain attributes materially
heterogeneous, and thus incompatible with each other.
Such combinatione, of attributes as circular virtue, or
coloured tlcouylzt, are of this character. ‘⁶ Black spirits
and white, red spirits and grey,” are only con-
ceivable by investing the spirits with a body for the
occasion, and not by connecting the idea of colour with
that of spirituality. To the same class belong all com-
binations of attributes inconsistent with the α priori
conditions of intuition3 such as a bilinearfiyure; which,
though not logically contradictory, are mathematically
inconceivable. These must be carefully distinguished
from those notions which, though empirically known to
be unreal, are yet perfectly consistent as thoughts, such as
the conception of a centaur, or of a golden mountain. In
respect of these last, Logic recognises no distinction
between the real and the unreal. An opposite class of
notions materially inconceivable, are those which are
defective, as separating attributes whose union is testified
by experience to be indispensable to conception. Thus,
inasmuch as we know by experiencc, that no surface can
be conceived, without being of some colour, and that no
colour can be conceived, except on some surface, the
conceptions of an uncoloured surface or an unextended
colour, though they present no logical contradiction,
