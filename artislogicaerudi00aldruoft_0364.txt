must be classed as essentially, though materially, incon—
ceivable ⁸.

As regards the truth or falsehood of Judgments, Logic
properly takes cognisance of Forma] Truth or Falsehood
only, which depends on the agreement or disagreement
of a thought with its own laws. Materia] Truth‚ which
is sometimes defined as consisting in the agreement of
the thought with its object, might be more correctly
explained as consisting in the agreement of the object
as represented in thought with the object as presented
in intuition3 for the object exists, relatively to uS‚
only as given in some form of intuition. But, however
it may be defined, it is manifest that no general law
or criterion of material truth and falsehood can be
given3 for the essence of such truth consists in its
adapting itself in every case to the diversities of this or
that special presentatiouh. To enumerate in detail all
the various sources of material falsehood would be
impossible3 I have contented myself with referring to
the three general heads of Mathematical‚ Metaphysical‚
and Physica] Judgments3 which appear to possess essen-
tially different degrees of certainty or impossibility.
These propositions will admit of a different classification‚
according to the theories held by different writers as to
their origin. By some, mathematica] judgments will be
classed with physical, as due solely to experience: by
others, they will be merged in logical truth or falsehood,
as owing their evidence to laws of thought. Metaphysical
judgmentS, again, will be considered by some as purely
empirical: while by others they will be referred to

g The error os those philosophers who maintain that colour can be
conceived without extensiou is exposed by Sir W. Hamilton, Reid's Worlcs,

svis-contradivtory, is shewn by Kuut, Lamse, Einleitunq, VII.
