lviii INTRonueTmN.

Let us bring together a few of these conflicting
witnesses. Logic is a, part of philosophyP. It is not
a part, but an instrumentq. It is both a part and an
instrumentr. It is both a soience and an art⁵. [t is
neither scienoe nor art, but an instrumenta] babitt.
It is a soienoe and not an artu. It is an art and nor,
a scieneeX. It is the soienoe of argumentatioffl—of
the operations of the mind so far as they are dirigible
by lawsz--of the syllogisn1⁹-—of the understanding in
relation to evidenoeb——of the lawe of thougth It is
the art of thinkingd—of 1·easoning²—-of the right use of
reason f—of dissertationg—of teachingh—of directing the
mind to any objecti—of forming instruments for the-
direction of the mindk.

Let us endeavour to disentangle some of the confusion
in which the reader may be involved by this multitude of
definitions. Logio was divided by the Sohoolmen into
