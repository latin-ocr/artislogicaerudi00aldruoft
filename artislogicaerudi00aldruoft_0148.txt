considers it an inferencoe otherwise it would be absurd to
prove it. Reid, in his Account of Aristotle's Logic, defines it
as an infel-enee, and the definition is accepted by his learned
Editor. Kant, too, regards both conversion and opposition as
sylloyisms of the understandiny, the new judgment being always
different in form, though not in matter, from the old. As
regards conversion per accidens, the original proposition is
clearly not identical with the converse; as it cannot be
substituted for it, but may be false, while the converse is true.
But on the new system of Sir W. Hamilton, the predicate
being quantified, and the proposition reduced to an equation
between the terms, it is better to consider the eonverted
proposition as identical with the original.
