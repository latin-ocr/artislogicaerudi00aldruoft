RUDIMENTA. 59

4. Subalternae A. Ι. vel E. O. et simul veroe, et
simul falsoe, et una vera, falsa altera esse possunt.
Nam 10. Si subalternans (nempe Universalis) vera
sit, Subalternata (sive Particularis) vera est (per l.
α.) 20. Si Subalternata falsa, Ergo Subalternans
*⁶ falsa (per 1. β.) 30. Si Subalternans falsa, Ergo
quae illi contradicit vera (per l.) Ergo hujus
Subcontraria, quae est Expositae Subalternata, vera
vel falsa esse potest (per 3.) 40. Si Subalternata
vera, Ergo quae illi contradicit falsa (per 1.) Ergo
hujus Contraria, quae est expositae Subalternans,
vera vel falsa esse potest (per 205 ⁷

y On the doctrine of Opposition in general, it may be
remarked, 1. That Subalterns are improperly classes] as
opposed proposiffions, and should be referred to a separate
table as immediate inferences. 2. That the Greek expressions
πᾶς-οὐ πᾶς, οὐδεὶς-ἔστι τις, are better adapted to signify the
relations both of opposition and of immediate inference than
their English substitutes all, none, and some. Some men is
naturally understood as meaning more than one, whereas
not all men includes one or any number short of the whole.
Hence the Aristotelian examples, πᾶς ἅνθρωπος λευκός, οὐ πᾶς
ἅνθρωπος λευκός, express a complete contradiction more accu-
rately than all men are white, some men are not white; as the
latter admits of a third possibility, one man is not white.
3. That there may be material as well as formal consequences
in opposition ancl immediate inferenoe, as well as in mediate
inference. Thus, all men are white, all men are blcwlc, are
materially, but not formally, contrary to each other. A is
φθαῖεν· than B, therefore Β is less than Α, is a material imme-
diate inference. The formal consequences alone come under
the cognisance of Logic.
