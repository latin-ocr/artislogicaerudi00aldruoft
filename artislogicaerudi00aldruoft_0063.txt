the Loyica docens and the Loqica utens, and the same
division had been made before by the Greek Com-
mentators, under the title of Logic without and with
application to things¹. The former denotes Logic in its
theoretical character, as concerned merely with the laws
and forms of thought3 the latter is the practical appli-
cation of thought to this or that object matter. The
discrepancies in the definition of Logic, as Science or
Art, may partly be traced to a confusion between these
two.

The Loyica docens is properly a Science and not an
Art. It is not correct to say, as has frequently been
said or implied by modern Logicians, that every Science
is an Art, because all knowledge admits of a practical
application. ‘⁶ The truth is,'’ says Bentham, ‘⁴ that how-
soever clearly distinguishable in idea, the two objects,
Art and Science, in themselves are not, in any instance,
found separate. In no place is any thing to be done,
but in the same place there is something to be known,-
in no place is any thing to be known, but in the same

place there is something to be donee The terms thus

extended are too vague to be of any value, and tend to
confuse rather than to distinguish. Science is not Art,
though soient-isio knowledge may be the basis of artistic.
A Science admits of a practical employment under

modo in quantum est, docens, et sic ex necessariis et propriis principiis
procedit ad. necessarias conclusiones, et sic cst scientia. Alio modo in
quantum utimur ea applicando eam ad illa in quibus est usus, et sic non

docetur quid, quomodo faciendum: utens vero est, quae ex praeceptis efficit

artis.'’ Smi-qlecii Loyica, Disp. ii. Qu. vi. For the parallel distinction
between Logic without and with applicatiou to things, (χωρὶς πραγμάτων,
