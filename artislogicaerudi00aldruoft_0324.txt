‘240 APPENDIX.

“ Every man who is learned has studied, because he
is learned.'’ Here the notion of study is implied in
that of learning, and the major premise is, “ All learned
beings have studied.” The hypothetica] proposition
thus becomes a complete syllogism, to which the sub-
sequent consequence is related as an episyllogism ⁰. In
the former case, where B stands for a physical cause,
,the judgment is synthetical, and indicates a material
consequence, which it requires some additional know-
ledge of facts to reduce to formal: e. g. “All wax
exposed to the fire melts, because it is exposed.” Here,
on materia] grounds, we know that we cannot supply the
premise, “ All bodies exposed to the fire melt;’⁷ but
only, “All bodies soluble by beat and exposed to the
fire melt,” In this case the consequence is extralogical,
and requires additional data not given in the thought.
But here also, when the judgment in question is em-
ployed as the premise of a reasoning, the conclusion
follows categorica11y3 though the premise itself cannot,
as it stands, be proved by a prosyllogism Ρ.

The Disjunctive Judgment is usually described as
representing a whole divided into two or more parts
mutually exclusive of each other, and the Disjunctive
