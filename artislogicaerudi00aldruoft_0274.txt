sense as “ animaP’ is of “man'' Whereas Locke's simple
ideas are exclusively ideas of attributes. By reference
then to Aristotle's account of the latter, it will plainly
appear that he and Locke mean two very different things
by Definition. With the former, it is an investigation
os the objective cause of a phenomenon3 with the latter,
an analysis of the subjective impression which that
phenomenon produces in the mind. The idea of an
interception of light is not part of the idea eclipse‚ but
the one phenomenon is the physical antecedent and
cause of the other. Inquiries of this kind are still
classed among the most important problems of Physica]
Science. What, for example, is light? Is it a succession
of material particles‚ or the undulations of an elastic
medium? The solution of this question would not be
a Definition in Locke’s sense of the w0rd3 i. e. it would
not be an analysis of the idea of light produced in the
mind by sensation. The same ina-y be said of colour.
The mental sensation of whiteness or redness is altogether
unaffected by the researches of Optios. The external
cause of colour, regarded as a quality of bodies, falls
directly within the province of the Soiencee. The de-
termination of such problems will be, in Aristotle⁷s sense
of the term, Definition.

This may be further illustrated by reference to a dis-
cussion of Aristotle’s which few probably have perused
for the first time, without considering it as singularly
vague and unsatisfactory. I mean the dissertation on
Pleasure, in the tenth Book of the Nicomachean Ethics.
We are struck with the absence of any thing like a
Definition or Analysis of the emoti0n3 and a reader who
commences the study of the book with some previous
knowledge of Locke's theory of Simple Ideas, will
probably be disposed to regard it as an attempt to define
