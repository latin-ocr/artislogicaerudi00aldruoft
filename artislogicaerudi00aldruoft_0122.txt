ξ. 8. DIVISIONEM excipitm (quae per Metapho-

potentially divisible into A which is B, and A which is not B;
and experience alone can determine whether either of these
members includes under it really existing individuals or not.
Logically‚ the division of animal into morta] and immortal is
as good as that into rational and irrational. But this division
is not strictly formal; for B, the dividing attribute, not being
part of the comprehension of A, has to be sought for out of
the mere act of thought, after A has been given. This has
been observed by Hoffbauer and Fries, who hence rightly
maintain, against Kant, that even dichotomy by contradiction
is not an act of formal thinking. Cf. Hoffbauer, Loqik, ᾗ. 138.
Fries System der Logsik‚ ξ. 92.

The only strictly formal process of this kind is that
distinguished as Determination, which consists in the reunion of
a genus and difference previously elicited by analysis from
a given concept. Formal Division thus presupposes Defi-
nition. See Drobisch, Neue Darstellung] der Loyilc, ξ. 17, 29, 30.

¹¹³ Eoeeipit. The reason of this order is given by Abelard:
“Quoniam vero divisiones definitionibus naturaliter priores
sunt, quippe ex ipsis constitutionis sure originem ducunt, in
ipso quoque tractatu divisiones merito priorem locum obtine-
bunt, definitiones vero posteriorem.” Dialecfflca, ed. Cousin.
p. 450. This is true in a material point of view; the matter
of a definition being some-times gained by division. But
termally, tho reverse order is preferable; a formal division
(ιι- determination being only possible aster (lefinition. See
tho, last noto.
