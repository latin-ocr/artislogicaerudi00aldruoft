APPENDIX. —2-27

Example differs from Induction in two priucipal
points. 1. Induction enumerates all the individuals
in the minor term, so as to constitute the middle: Ex-
ample selects single instances. ἱ). Induction stops at
the universal conclusion: Example proceeds to infer
syllogistically a conclusion concerning another indi-
vidualb.

The Examp]e‚ as thus exhibited‚ has no loyical value
as an independent reasoning. We are not warranted in
assuming, as a necessary law of thought, that two things
which resemble each other in any one ‘qiven quality must
likewise resemble each other in augy other& The reason-
ing may have more or less material weight‚ according
to the character of the particular qualities compared,
and to what we may empirically know of their connection
with each other. It thus comes under the kind of
evidence mentioned by Bishop Butler‘¹ as probable‚·
which admits of degrees, and of all variety of them,
from the highest moral certainty to the very lowest
presumption. But degrees of evidence are inadmissible
in Pure Logic. Either the conclusion necessarily
follows from the admitted truth of the premises‚ or it
does not. In the former case, all reasonings are in a
logical point of view equally necessary3 in the latter, all
are equally worthlesse. That the infcrence in Example
is material, not formal, appears the instant we attempt
to state it in symbolica] form: e. g. A and Β are both
X, A is also Y, therefore B is Y. This reasoning has no

force until we know the matter, i. e. what particular
objects are signified by A and Β, Χ and Yf.
