112 Aa'ris LOGICAE

CAP. V.
De Syllogz'smo quoad Materiam.

ᾗ. 1. HAEc de Syllogismo quoad Formam spec-
tato. Jam de eodem quoad Materiam, h. e. Certi-
tudz'nem et Evidentz'am propositionum ex quibus
componitur.

Certa autem propositio est, cui nihil occurrit
in contrarium, vel quod occurrit instar nihili est3
ut, Omnis homo est risibilisa: Evidens, quae simul

² This definition is vague enough: the example, however,
shews more clearly what is intended. For risibile was
regarded as a property, flowing from, and demonstrabis} by,
the differentia rationale. We may therefore define a certain
proposition as ⁸⁶ a proposition capable of demonstration.''
It will thus be distinguished from an evident proposition,
which is axiomatiC and indemonstrable. Both are, of course,
necessary, which is essential to demonstrative reasoning:
but the former is the conclusion of a demonstration; the
latter, a premise. Waiving the physical question of the
necessary connection of risibility and rationality, we may
give as examples‚ of a certain proposition, ‘² The angles of
every triangle are equal to two right angles;'’ of an evident,
“ Things which are equal to the same are equa] to each
other.’⁷

Such scenis clearly to be Aldrich's meaning in the present
passage; in which certa and evidens correspond to what arc
commonly called imvwdiam tmmedietaw subjecti, and immediata
immedietate cazcsoe. (Cf. Sanderson, lib. 3. cap. 12. from whom
this part is chiefly taken.) Aldrich's snbsequent language,
however, is by no means consistent. '
