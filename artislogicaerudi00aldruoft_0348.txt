conceived to exist in magnitudes regarded as modi-
fications of space may also be perceived to exist in
similar magnitudes regarded as portious of bodies. The
perfect straight line and the perfect triangle and the
perfect circle are not merely imaginable forms, but
tangible substances. But it is further assumed by the
author, that the sensible properties of bodies, whose very
existence can only be proved by the testimony of expe-
rience, may exist, along with the Geometrical qualities, in
a manner in which experience has never presented them.
Thus “ figures of all kinds, lines aud points,” are “ always
considered as exhibited on a hard body of some kind,
which causes the position of the several parts or points
to be fixed with relation to one another, and will, on
occasion, be supposed to be turned about an assigned
point or points, in any manner that can be shewn to be
practicable with the hard body on which they are under-
stood to be represented. Nevertheless, the application
of one object to another will, when required, be imagined
to take place without bar of corporea] substance 3——that
is to say, without impediment from the existence of
other parts than those it is desired to compare.” In
other words, the surface of a solid and the linear boundary
of a surface may be considered ad libitum asin or out
of connection with the bodies of which they form part,
retaining in both cases the attributes of body, such as
hardness. Surely such assumptions as these, be they
legitimate or illegitimate, are to be treated as postulates
or axioms. At any rate they are not definitions.

But further: a Body is defined to bc “ any thing that
ean be made the object of touch ;'’ and a hard body is
“ a body which resists all change of form.'' But bodies
which resist all change of form are assumed at the same
time not to resist all change of sizo, for the genesis of
the straight lino and the proof of the axiom of parallels
