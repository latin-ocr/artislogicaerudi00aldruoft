proved by experience to be universally necessary in
practice, both to the formation and to the communication
of thought3 and any defect in this indispensable instru-
ment is communicated to the operations which it per-
forms. This was clearly seen by Aristotle and his
followers, who have assigned a prominent, indeed too
prominent, a place to language in their classification, by
dividing Fallacies, in the first instance, into those in
dictione and those eoetra dictionem ,Î‡ according as the de->
ception does or does not depend upon the particular words
in which the reasoning is conveyedb. Looking to the
actual position of language in relation to thought, it will
be better to adopt a threefold division of Fallacies3 those
in the Thought, those in the Matter, and those in the
Language3 the last corresponding to the fallaciae in dic-
tione of Aristotle3 the two former representing a still more
important though often neglected distinction, which is
lost sight of in the vague negation of eoelra dictionem.

In the application of this principle of division to the
several operations of Thought, as exhibited in the follow-
ing Table, some slight differences will be observed,
which in some instances will explain themselves, while
in others a few preliminary words os explanation may
be desirable. Fallacies of Language, it is obvious, will
become more numerous as the process of thought be-
comes more complicated. While a Concept can be
misapprehended only in the term (whether expressed by
one word or more) in which it is conveyed, a Judgment
may be ambiguous, either in the meaning of one of its
terms, or in its entire constructi0n3 and a Reasoning
admits of still further ambiguity, from the repetition of a
term or sentence in different senses. Hence a different
enumeration of Fallacics in dictione will be required in
different parts of the Table.
