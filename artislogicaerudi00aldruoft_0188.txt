confounded with the inquiry, whether the hypothetical pro-
position is formally the same with the categorical. The latter
is answered by Kant in the negative, but that decision does
not affect the present question. The reduction of hypothetical
syllogisms must be governed by the sanie rules as that of
eategoricals; and in the latter case, it is allowable to substitute
for a given proposition another which, though not identical, is
implied by it. For instance, a particular proposition may be
employed in the place of an universal. So in hypotheticals,
if the new propositions contain the same ternis, and are
immediately deducible froin the original ones, the reduction ’
is legitimate. This will generally be the case when the
hypothetical proposition has but three ternis; both clauses
having the same subject or the same predicate. The following
instances may thus be reduced :-——

Ι. If All A is B, Al] A is C, All B is O,
But AllAisB3 ] to [AllAisB;
All A is C. All A is C.
’[Ι. If All A is B, All C is B, All Ais B,
But All A is B; } to {All C is A;
All C is B. All C is B.
These syllogisms‚ indeed, were admitted by the Ramists,
the great advocates of hypotheticals, to be categorical. But
where the hypothetical has four ternis, as, “ Is A is B, C is
D‚” this mode of reduction is not practicable; yet even in
this case a categorical syllogism may be constructed, whose
propositions‚ though expressed in different ternis, are implied
in thoso of the original syllogism. Thus:

Constructive. Destructive.
Every case of A being B, is a Every case of A being B, is a
case of C being D. case of C being D.
'l’his is a case of A being B. This is nota case of C being D.
