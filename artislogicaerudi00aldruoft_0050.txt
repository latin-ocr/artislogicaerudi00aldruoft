means. To entitle any work to be classed as the Logic
of this or that school, it is at least necessary that it
should, in common with the Aristotelian Logic, adhere
to the syllogistic method, whatever modifications or
additions it may derive from the particular school of its
author. In this point of view, the Baconian school may
be represented by the Logics of Hobbes and Gassendi3
the Cartesian, by those of Clauberg and Arnauld3 that
of Locke, by Le Clerc and 'S Gravesande²²3 that of
Leibnitz, by Wolf, Baumgarten, and his editor Meyer.
The Logic of Hobbes was the natural result of the
utilitarian spirit predominant in the method of Bacon.
The results, indeed, which Hobbes deduced, would pro-
bably in many points have been rejected by his master3
but the indirect influence of Bacon is manifest through-
out. The end of knowledge, according to Hobbes,
is power, and the scope of all speculation is the perform-
ance of some action, or thing to be done. In this we
recognise the echo of the words of Bacon, ‘⁶ Meta scien—
tiarum vera et legitima non alia est quam ut dotetur vita
humana novis inventis et copiisb.” Reasoning, accord-

of Loeke, has produced more than one tremisse nominally on Logic; the
principa] ones being those of Condillac and Destutt de Tracy. But
these have nothing in common with the Aristotelian system. Condillac
regards Logic as nn art of thinking, but thought is identified with sensation,
and the procoss of reasoning is nothing but the analysis os our sensatione
by means of language. Hence his declaration, tout [ἀνί de raisonner se reduit
ὰ l’art (Ie bien parler. In the system of De Tracy, Logic is the science os
the characteristics and canses os trnth and error in the conibination of
our ideas. His work is strictly psychological, exnmining, on the extreme
sensationalist hypothesis, into the formation of ideas and their different,
modes of combination.
