APPENDIX. 211

The Syllogism in the first figure is alone logically valid.
In the second, there is an undistributed middle term: in
the third, an illicit process of the minor.

The σημεῖον is defined by Aristotle, πρότασις ἀποδεεκτικὴ
ἀναγκαία ’ὴ ’ἔνδοξος ; in which the words necessary and
probable do not relate to the modal character of the
Proposition in itself, but to the nature of its connexion
with the Conclusion which it is adduced to prove, i. e. to
its loyical validity when the other premise is added⁶;
without which addition, eoepressed or understood, there is
no Enthymeme at alle.

But it may be thought that the above examples do not
furnish a sufficient criterion for distinguishing between
the two kinds of Enthymeme. If both premises must be
mentally, and may be orally, supplied, before there is
any Enthymeme at all, how are we to determine whether
any given specimen is an instance of reasoning from a
sign, or from a likelihood? Why, for example, in the

‘¹ Rhet. i. 2. 17. Ἀναγκαΐα μὲν οὖν λέγω ἐξ ὧν γίνεται συλλογισμός. Cf.
Anal. Pr. i. 1. 6, Συλλογισμὸς δέ ἐστι λόγος ἐν ᾧ τεθέντων τινῶν ἕτερόν τι
τῶν κειμένων ἐξ ἀνάγκης συμβαίνει. Here sylloyism is used in its strietest
sense. From another passage in the Rhetoric (i. 2. 14.) it has sometimes
been imagined that all σημεῖα are necessary, at least as propositions; and
the σημεῖον has even been defined, “ a proposition in necessary matter;’'
as if ‘⁶ necessary matter” were the proper province of Rhetoric. The inter-
pretation however is too inconsistent with Aristotle’s Subsequent language
to be tenable. The words in question, if properly belonging to this place,
(the resemblance to Rhet. i. 2. 8. is suspicious‚) must be so interpretes] as
to identify the necessary propositions with one class only of σημεῖα, the
τεκμήρια. The reference to the Analytics Ι conceive to allude, not to the
account of modal conclusions cleduced from moda] premises, but to the
necessary conclusiveness of premises logically connected, as opposed to the
more or less probable conclusiveness of illogical combin ations. As a special
reference, supply Anal. Pr. i. 27. 12.

Ε Anal. Pr. ii. 27. 4. Ἐὰν μὲν οῧν ἡ μία λεχθῇ πρότασις, σημεῖον ’γίνεται
μόνον, ἐὰν δὲ καὶ ἡ ἑτέρα προσληφθῇ, συλλογισμός. The context shews that
he is speaking of Syllogism only in the looser sense in which all Enthy=

memes are included.
