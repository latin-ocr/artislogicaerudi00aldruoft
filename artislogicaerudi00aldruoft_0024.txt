Socratis
Induction.

XX INTRODUCTION.

forgeries of a later period, the Categories attributed to
Archytas, and the other logical relies of the Pythagorean
schoolss. There remain two important logical dis-
coveries attributed by Aristotle to Socrates, Induction
and Definitionb. The Induction, however, of Socrates
is not, like that of Aristotle, a strictly formal process
of reasoning from the aggregate of particulars to the
universal constituted by them. It rather resembles the
Aristotelian Example or Parab1e0, being a material
inference from a selected number of similar or analogous
cases to another individua] instance under discussion.
As a specimen, may be taken the following argument
from the Gorgias. ΣΩ. Τι’ οὖν; 6 τοὶ τεκτονικά μεμαθηκώς
τεκτονικός, ἢ οὕς ΓΟΡ. Ναί. ΣΩ. Οὐκοῦν καὶ 6 τοὶ μουσικοὶ
μουσικόςς ΓΟΡ. Ναί. ΣΩ. Καὶ ὁ τοὶ ἰατρικαὶ ἰατρικός καὶ
τᾶλλα οὕτω κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν λόγον· 6 μεμαθηκώς ἕκαστα τοιοῦτός
ἐστιν οἷον ἡ ἐπιστήμη ἕκαστον ἀπεξγάζεταις ΓΟΡ. Πάνυ γε.
ΣΩ. Οὐκοῦν κατὰ τοῦτον τὸν λόγον καὶ 6 τοὶ δίκαια μεμαθηκώς
&Knauson ΓΟΡ. Πάντως δῆπουᾱ. Α reasoning of this kind
has no place in a system of Formal Logic. That
science recognises no inference that is not necessitated
by the laws of thought3 whereas in instances like the
above, it is obvious that the premises may be true, and
yet the conclusion falsee. Or two speciinens may be
found, both eomplying with the above form, one of
which shall carry conviction to every reasonable man,
while the other is utterly worthless, Its moral force
may thus vary ‘⁶ from the highest moral certainty to the
very lowest presumptionf.⁷' Its loyieal value is zer0.
