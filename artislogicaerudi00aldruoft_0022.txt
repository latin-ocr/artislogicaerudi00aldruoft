combined with the universality of their aims, and the
consequent failure of each in the attempt to resolve diffi-
culties beyond their respective provinces—all this could
hardly fail to produce a spirit of scepticism, which should
end in denying the possibility of attaining to truth at
allt. The decline of the philosophy of things was
naturally accompanied by a corresponding rise of the
method of words: the denia] of all real truth stimulated
the invention of verba] devices for producing the appear-
ance of truth as occasion might require. Such was the
origin of the eristic method of the Sophists. They
employed it chiefly to enforce their leading dogma of
the unreality of all knowledge, speculative or practical.
Accordingly, they endeavoured, by ingenious applications
of the dialectic mode of reasoning, to involve those with
whom they disputed in sels-contradictions and ab·
surdities3 thus contributing at the same time to under-
mine all fixed principles of knowledge, and to procure
a temporary triumph for the disputant. With these
practica] applications of the dialectic method, seem to
have been coupled corresponding speculations on the
theory of thought, and of its exponent, language3 traces of
which remain in the doctrine attributed to Protagoras,
denying the possibility of falsehood in opinion or
speech, from the absence of any objective reality in
thing-3¹13 and in the theory noticed by Plato in the
Cratylus, which, almost anticipating the views of Hobbes
and Condillac, declared the knowledge of things to be
dependent on the right use of wordsv. At a later period,
the eristic method was adopted and pursued to a con-
siderable extent by Euclid of Megara, and his successors
Eubulides, Diodorus Cronus, Alexinus, and Stilpo.
