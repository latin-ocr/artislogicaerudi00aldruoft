was never dreamed of by Aristotle, and will scarcely claim
implicit belief in the present day. But it is not merely
because the revolution effected in this branch of Science
has invalidated the individua] example, that the inter-
pretation is objected to3 but because the words of Aris-
totle himself expressly direct us to another criterion.
The Demonstrations of Geometry are still extant in the
same form in which they existed in the days of the
Stagirite. Though Euclid himself, the oldest remaining
Geometer, is a few years younger than A1·istotle‘¹‚ yet,
except on the very improbable hypothesis that he was
the original inventor of the whole contents of his
Elements, that work must be regarded as furnishing a
fair specimen of the demonstrations treated of iu the
Posterior Analytics. By this touchstone, Aristotle and
his interpreters may be tested. When any modern
Herlinus or Dasypodius¹' shall exhibit a single demon-
stration of Euelid in —the form of a scholastic demonstratio
potissima, we may then recognise this foundling of the
Schoolmen as the legitimate offspring of their maste1·⁸.
Til] that is done, we must continue to believe that
Aristotle was sufficiently acquainted with the use of his
own instrument, to be able to give a correct Logical
Analysis of the Demonstrations of Geometry.

‘1 Euclid fleurished in the reign os Ptolemy Lagus, ΒΕ. 323—283. This
period, however, probably corresponds to the close, not to the commence—
ment, ef his lise. This would make him partly contemporary with, though
about thirty years junior te, Aristotle.

Logioians,” as Sir W. Ilamilton calls them, a specimen will be found in

the next note.

and os Wolf, Phil. leat. ξ. 498. Both, however, treat the scholastic form as
Aristotelian.
