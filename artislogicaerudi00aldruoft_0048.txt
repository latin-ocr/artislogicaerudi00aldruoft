Melanch· On the other hand, the Aristotelian Logia, purified of
thou. many of its scholastic accessions, was defended and
taught by Melanchthon. The earlier editions of his
Erotemata Dialectica preceded the attacks of Ramus¹3
but in 1547 he published a new edition, in the intro-
duction to which he says, “Ego veram, incorruptam,
nativam Dialecticen, qualem et ab Aristotele et aliquot
ejus non insulsis interpretibuS, ut ab Alexandro Aphro-
disiensi et Boethio accepimus, praedico. . . . Etsi multi
Aristotelicos libros vituperant, et tanquam tabulas dis-
persas fraetae navis esse dicunt, tamen, si quid ego
judicare possum, affirmo eos Dialecticen recte tradere,
et ab iis, qui liberali doctrina exculti sunt, intelligi
posse.'' Melanchthon however agrees with Ramus in
considering Logic as an Art. “ Dialectica,’' he sayS, “est
ars seu via recte, ordine, et perspicue docendi3 quod fit
recte definiendo, dividendo, argumenta vera connectendo,
et male cohaerentia seu falsa retexendo et refutando.'’
Under their united sanction, this became the prevailing
doctrine of Logicians. The authority of Melanchthon
established the Aristotelian Logic in the Protestant
schools of Germany and Holland, and in Britain. At a
later period, a conciliation was attempted between this
Later* system and that of Ramus. Burgersdyck, in 1626,

Aristotelians, the Ramists, and the mixed school repre-
sented by Keckermann, Aristotelian in matter, Ramist
in methody. These were called Philippo-Ramists, οι·
Semi-Ramists3 and were rejected by the genuine dis-
ciples of Ramus, as Pseudo-Ramists. Among the English
Ramists of the sevontocnth century, the most learned
