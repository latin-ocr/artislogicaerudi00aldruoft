S “Genus speciebus materia est. Nam sicut aes, accepta
forma, transit in statuam, ita genus, accepta differentia, transit
in speciem.’' Boethius de divisione. But as logicians, we are
not warranted in introducing any portion of the essence of
tliiizys, but only of concept-s or 9eozeral noticiis. The whole
essence of a concept is the sum of the attributes which it
comprehends, and this can only be fully decl-ared by its
definitifflz, not, as Aldrich says, by species. The Genus or
material part of two given concepts, (to speak of the material or
formal part of a sinyle concept is nonsense,) is the sum of
those attributes which are common to both 3 as the difference
or formal part is composed of those attributes which are
peculiar to each. Thus, if there be given three concepts,
containing respectively the attributes, ab, ac, bc, α is the
genus of the first compared with the second, b and c the
respective differences. But if the first is compared with the
third, b becomes the common genus, a and c the respective
differences. In this, the only tenable logical point of view,
there can be no such thing as an absolute genus or
difference.

t Necessario—Contioisycntcr. This distinction is based on
the supposition that certain attributos are necessarily eon-
nected with others, from which they flow, as effect from
cause. Thus risibility was described in the scholastic philo-
sophy as necessarily flowing from rationalius, in the same
manner as having the anglos at the base equal to each other
necessarily results from tho equality of two siclos in an
