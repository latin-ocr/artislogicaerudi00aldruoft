That the distinctions of substance, quality, and the other
categories, are founded on grammatical grounds, is shewn by
Trendelenburg, Elem. Loy. Arist. ξ. 3.

The reader of Locke must not confound this distinction
with that between substances and modcs; Essay, b. ii. ch. 12.
(Cf. Descartes, Princ. i. 48. Port-Royal Logic‚ p. i. ch. 2.)
A quality is predicatecl in qnid of another quality, as well as
a substance of a substance3 e. g. “ Prudence is a virtue.''
Cf. Pacius on Top. i. ξ. 3. Port-Royal Logic, part i. ch. 7.

The distinction between Qualequid and Quale is not
warranted by Porphyry. According to him, Differentia, Pro-
prium, and Accidens are all predicated, ἐν τῷ ὁποῖόν τί ἐστιν.
Boethius distinguishes them as Quale in substantia and Quale
ozon in substantia. The vulqatoe definitiones which follow are
the original definitions of Porphyry, adopted by most subse-
quent Logicians.

'¹' Specie vel numero, i. e. generic difference de specie dff-
fcrentibuae specific, de womero (iffa-entibus. But this would
not be allowed by Porphyry, according to whom differentia
is always predicated de specie differentibus. The remaining
definitions might be supplied as follows; Species, quod de
pluribus womero differentibus in. Quid. Proprium, quod de
pluribus 'numero differentibus in Quale. Accidens, qnod dc plu-
ribus (Jencrc vel specie vel munero differentibus in Quale. The
two last, however, arc not given as definitions by Porphyry.
