definiri possunt ad hunc modum. Quicquid in
multis reperiri potest, vel est tota eorum essentia,
vel ejus pars, vel cum essentia conjunctum‘.
Quare Universalia vel (quod eodem redit) Prae-
dicabilia sunt quinque, et non plura3 videlicet,

Aristotelian Logic, taken from the Isagoge or Introduction
to the Categories by Porphyry, written in the third century.
Aristotle's doctrine, as far as it can be gathered from the
Topics, differs from that of Porphyry in several points; as
does the latter from the view adopted by Aldrich.

r Quicquid in multis, διο. These definitions are taken from
Albertus Magnus, (de Praedicab. T ract. II. cap. 1.) and were
generally adopted by the Realists‚ in the form of introduction
to, or coinmentary on, the Definitions given by Porphyry.
The Nominalists, on the other hand, expressly denied that
any predicable was of the essence of the individual. See
Occam, Logica, p. i. cap. 20, 21. To discuss the full bear-
ings of this controversy would exceed the limits of a note.
It will be sufficient to observe, that a considerable portion of
the language adopted by Aldrich is not even intelhgible,
except on realistic principlesg and that whenever the same
language is adopted by a Nominalist, he is inevitably involved
in inconsistencies and sels-contradictions. The same is in
some degree true of the original exposition of Porphyry,
though the latter professes to leave the question of Nomi—
nalism and Realism open. But the question of the existence
of universals a parte rei is metaphysical‚ not logical, and
no theory on this point ought to influenee the language of
Logic. The rules of Logic are primarily regulative of
ε]ιοη91ιῖ3; and equally so, whatever opinion we may hold
concerning the essence of thin‘qs. For this reason, it is
necessary to alter nearly the whole of Aldrich's language,
in speaking of the logical predicables. On the realist point
of view, see further, Appendix, note A.
