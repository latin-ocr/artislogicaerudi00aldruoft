straight line as length without breadth: we are 'required
to conceive it as such that two straight lines cannot
enclose a space. The definition itself is but an im—
perfect attempt to describe in general terms what is
known much more clearly by the image. It may serve
to lead the thoughts of the learner to the proper image3
but it was itself founded on a previous image in the
mind of the teacher3 and if the definitior] and the image
differ, the former is in fault, not the latter.

III. This brings us to our 1hi1·d theory, which is that
maintained by Kant. According to this theory, the
fundamental assumptions of Geometry are Proper Aoeiom,
or synthetical judgments apriori; and the possibility of
forming such judgments depende on the power of con-
structing the objects to which they refer in a pure
intuition, i. e. in an intuition containing no adventitious
element external to the mind itself. The images of
geometrica] figures differ from all others in being, not
represented modifications of body, but presented modi-
fications of space3 and the universal validity of the
synthetical judgments is a consequence of the universal
presence of space as the form of every possible per-
ception of body.

Three of these synthetical judgments are given in the
loth, llth‚ and thh axioms of Euclid3 and either these
or other axioms analogous to these must be assumed as
evident by intuition‚ before any of the properties of
more complex figures can be made known by demon-
stration. I do not say that Euclid has given the best
and simplest forms of these axioms‚ but that in some
form or other they are indispensable. To regard all
such axioms as possibly demonstrable theorems is to be
ignorant of the logical conditions under which demon-
stration is possible3 fora synthetical judgment is de-
monstrable only on the condition that another synthetical
