18ss APPENDIX.

We have next to consider the Definitions of Sub-
stances. Here too the investigation of Cause is the
root of the whole inquiry; but the manner in which it.
is conducted is not at first sight so obvious as in the
former case. To ask the cause of an attribute, is to ask
why the subject is so affected. Why, for example, is the
moon eclipsed? But what is meant by the cause of a
man, aud in what form will the question be proposed?
To ask why man exists, is in fact to ask why there are
such beings in the world,—a question admitting only of
Grangousier's solutionq,—and, when so solved, contri-
buting nothing towards the Definition. To ask why a
man is a man, is, as Aristotle himself observes, futiler.
The only form in which the question can be put is, Why
is this or that individua] 3 111311 ? What 316 1116 6556111131
001151111161115 of the 11011011 Μ311, 1116 possession of which
entitles Socrates to be reekoned in 1116 class? Here too
the formal cause determines the Definition.

These Definitions form the first of the three kinds
distinguished in Anal. Post. ii. 10. 4. ’Ἔστιν ἄρα ὁρισμὸς εἷς
μὲν λόγος τοῦ τί ἐστιν ἀναπόδεικτος. These Definitions are
assumed prior to 311 (161110115113110115, and are real, inas-
much as the existence of the objects is assumed with
them. The ground of the assumption will vary according
to the nature of the object to be definedt.

With regard to the third class of DefinitionS, described
as τῆς τοῦ τί ἐστιν ἀποδείξεως συμπέρασμα, Commentators

But to support this interpretation requires considerable straining of
Aristotle’s language.
