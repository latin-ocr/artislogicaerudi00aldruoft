30 Auris LOGICAE

nullia, Species infima, quae omni cognato Generi

described, are both merely imaginary limits, never arrived at
in any process of actual thought. The notion of Being] or
even of substance in general, apart from this or that special
combination of attributes, and that of a combination so
complex as to admit of no additional attributes in thought,
are both psychologically inconceivable. A Highest Genus
and a Lowest Species may be admitted in any material
science, as the limits at which the investigations of that
science begin and end 3 but such a limitation is made entirely
on material grounds, relatively to the purpose of that par—
ticular science, and cannot be recognised by Logic. See
Appendix, note A.

a The Aristotelian Logicians consider the summa ymera as
ten in number, viz. the ten Categories or Predicaments of
Aristode. These are οὐσία, ποσόν, ποιόν, πρός τι, ποῦ, ποτέ, κεῖσθαι,
ἔχειν, ποιεῖν, πάσχεινς usually translated, Substance, Quantity,
Quality, Relation, Place, Time, situation, Possession, Action,
Passion. The Gategories have by different commentators
been regarded as a classification of names, of things, and of
both; and have been alternately banished to Metaphysics
and recalled to Logic. Whatever position they may hold in
the Metaphysical writings of Aristotle, in his Logical ones
they are expressly declared to be a division of the notions
signified by simple ternis. Ens (τὸ ὅν) was not regarded as a
summum ιᾳοηῑιε to the several categories‚ being considered by
Aristotle and his followers as predicable of them, not uni-
vocally, but equivocallffl or rather analogyously. But a classifi-
cation of Categories is out of place in Forma] Logic. From
the analysis of any notion‚ whether given in itself or as form-
ing part of a judgment, I can by mere thinking arrive at the
simplest elements it contains3 but Ι cannot by mere think-
ing determine that all notions so analysed will lead me to
exactly ten such elements‚ neither more nor less. This
requires a knowledge, not merely of all the forms of thought,
but also of all the characteristics of the objects about which
wo can think. On the principle of the Aristotelian Cate-
