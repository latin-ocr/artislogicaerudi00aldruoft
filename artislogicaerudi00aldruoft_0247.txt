APPENDIX. 163

Species at Homo, has an obvious and sufficient answer.
I did not make the world, he might say. Substances,
universal as well as singular, exist independently of
me: I state facts as I find them, and am not bound to
determine why they are so. But let a Conceptualist or
Nominalistf talk of a Lowest SpecieS, and he is refuted
at once by his own fundamental doctrine. The several
Species are our own creation, as abstract ideas, or as
significations of words. You have no right arbitrarily
to declare that you will form complex conceptions thus
low and no lower3 or, at least, if you fix such limits for
your own convenience, you have no right to impose the
same restriction on others.

The same remarks apply to the theory of an absolute
differentia, such as rationale, predicable of all men and
of none but men, and serving to distinguish that species,
not from some other given species, but from all others
whatever. Porphyry, as has been before observed, ad—

t· Between Nominalism and Conceptualism there is no real difference,
unless in conjunction with the latter we maintain the power of the mind
to form Universal notions, unaided by verbal or other symbols. And even
then, all Nominaljsm will be Coneeptualism, though all Conceptuah'sm
will not be Nominalisni. For Universals can only be identified with names
by considering these as the signs of notions. Yet Ν ominalism has been
acc-,used as destructive of all Philosophy, and that by the advocates of
Conceptualism. But the fundamental error of Hobbes and his followers
is not their doctrine of Universal Terms, but their theory of the import of
Proposizions. The two, however, are not necessarily connected, We may
adopt Locke’s theory of abstract ideas, without maintaining with him that
knowledge is the perception of the agreement or diagreement of two
ideas3 and we may hold that general notions require the aid of language,
without maintaining with Hobbes, that truth and falsehood depend on
names, or with Condillac, that science is only a language well constructed.
But, not to argue this point here, we may observe, that the Scholastic
Nominalists, at least Abelard and Occam, were Conceptualists. With
regard to Roscehn, it is hardly fair, upon the slight notices we possess of
his views, to identify his Nominalism with that of Hobbes, whom Leibnitz
rightly calls plusquam Nominalis. ¹ No one ean suppose Abelard's deductio
ad absurdum to be a fair statement of Roscelin’s views‚
