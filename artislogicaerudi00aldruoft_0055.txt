published in 1728. Wolf is regarded by Kant as the
representative of the dogmatic philosophy. Philosophy
with Wolf is the science of things possible, so far as
they are possible, and contains three principa] branches,
Theology, Psychology, and Physics. The criterion of
the possible is the principle of contradiction. thatever
is not contradictory is possibleh. Logic directs the
mind in the knowledge of all being3 its principles being
drawn on the one side from Ontology, on the other
:from Psychology. The Loqz'ca Doeens is defined by
Wolf as a Practical Science3 the Loqica Utens as an
Art3 the former being acquired by teaching, the latter
by practice. The details ofW01f's Logic are prIncipally
Aristotelian, with one or two ingenious but perverse
refinements. Thus, he reduces subaltern opposition to
a syllogism with an identical minor premise, and all
immediate consequences to abridged hypothetical syl-
logisms. Induction he regards, like Archbishop thately,
as a syllogism with the major premise suppressed. Wolf
is also the author of a smaller Logic in German, of which
there is a good English translation, published in 1770.

To the same school as &Vols belong Baumgarten and Baum-
Meyer. Baumgarten is highly praised by Kant for his ῗῗζέξῒ
concentration of the WVolfian system. An annotated copy
of Meyer's Logic is the foundation of that of Kant
himselfi.

may be regarded as uniting in a great measure the
doctrines of the antagonist schools of Locke and Leibnitz,
and as the precursor of the Critique of Kant. His
system is divided into four principa] parts, contributing
conjointly to the investigation and communication of
truth: Dianoz'oloyy, or the doctrine of the laws and
