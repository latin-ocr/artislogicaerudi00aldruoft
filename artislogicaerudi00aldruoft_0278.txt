every attempt at such demonstration necessarily involves
a petitio principii. The reason is obvious: since a
definition can be predicated essentially (ἐν τῷ τί ἐστι) of
nothing but that of which it is a definition3 and since,
to prove a conclusion concerning the essence, the pre-
mises must be of the same character-5 the middle term
assumed must be identical With the minor, and the major
premise with the conclusion.

Such is Aristotle's theory of Definition. Its funda-
mental principle may still, mutatis mutandis, be retained,
notwithstanding that the speculations of modern philo—
sophy have considerably modified his distinction of
Substances and Attributes. Properly speaking, indeed,
all Definition is an inquiry into Attributes. Our com-
plex notions of Substances can only be resolved into
various Attributes, with the addition of an unknown
substratum .·——a something to which we are compelled to
regard these Attributes as belongingm. Man, for example,
is analysed into Animality, Rationality, and the some-
thing which exhibits these phenomena. Pursue the
analysis, and the result is the same. 'We have a some-
thing corporeal, animated, sensible, rational. An un-
known constant must always be added to complete the
integration; unfortunately we have no means of de-
termining its value. Still, this does not affect the basis
of the Aristotelian distinction. For some phenomena
can be accounted for by other phenomenal causes: in
others, we must acquiesce in the conviction that they are
so, merely because they are. It is clearly impossible
for the mere hypothesis of an unknown substratum to
explain the reason of all the variety of attributes which
different objects exhibit.

One further question remains How far Definition
properly belongs to the province of Logic, was, as we
