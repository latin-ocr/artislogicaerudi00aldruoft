the proof may be given in categorical syllogisms. ln
others, it is far more naturally exhibited in the hypo-
thetical form. A hypothetical premise is sometimes
the only materially allowable assumption in cases where
the given antecedent and consequent have both terms
distinct. E. g. A is Β, therefore O is D. We may supply,
If A is Β, C is D3 but to determine the truth of the
assumed proposition, whether it be hypothetical or
categorical, does not fall within 'the province *of the
Logician. It may be questioned, however, whether the
mere assumption of a hypothetica] premise can make a
material consequence formal. See below, Note Ι.
Among these material, and therefore extralogieal,
Consequences, are to be classed those which Reid
adduces as cases for which Logic does not provide3
e. g. “Alexander was the son of Philip, therefore
Philip was the father of Alexander ;'’ “A is greater
than B, therefore B is less than A.'' [n both these it
is our material knowledge of the relations “father and

son,” ‘⁴ greater and less,⁷’ that enables us to make the
inference.

Another of Reid⁷s examples is the following: “A is
equal to Β, and Β is equa] to C, therefore A is equal
to O.” This reasoning is elliptical, and therefore, as it
stands, materia13 though, owing to the suppressed premise
being sels-evident, its deficiency is apt to be overlooked.
Stated in logical form, the syllogism runs thus:

Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other;
A and G are equal to the same,

Therefore A and G are equa] to each othei-².

Another example of the same kind is that sometimes
called reasoning a fortiori. E. g. “ A is greater than B,
