APPENDIX. 197

analogous to that of drawing formal inferences, virtually
contained in their premises, though not explicitly de-
velopedp. lt is a process of sels-examination, not dis-
similar to the Platonic application of Dialecfflc, though
widely differing as regards the objective truth of its
results. For the Logical process furnishes only a sub-
jective criterion: it enables us to represent more dis-
tinctly to the mind, the notions previously existing there
in more or less confusion: its rules direct us to compare
concepts one with another, and furnish some security
for our own consistency in employing them ; but they do
not enable us to ascertain their accordance with external
objects, or to add the deficient parts, where they are
inadequate representatives of the latter. The mind, like
the sky, has its nebulae, which the telescope of Logic
may resolve into their component stars. But here the
parallel ceases. The Logical instrument discovers no
luminary whose rays have not previously entered the
eye3 it tells us nothing of their relative distances, of
the velocity with which their light travels; of any thing,
in short, which did not form a confused portion of the
sensuous representation ¹¹. This may seem but beggarly
service to be performed by the Art of Arts and Science
of Sciences. Inferior certainly it is to the gigantic pur-
poses which more than one Logical Titan has essayed
to accomplish with the same instrument. But let not its
legitimate uses be contemned, because it has abated
somewhat of the “vaulting ambition which o'erleaps
itself.'’ It furnishes the mould by which the ever—
accumulating matter os consciousness is reduced to form
and consistency: it were nngrateful to despise it, because
it does not also dig the metal itself from the mine.
