viduum, ita et Communis Dividua dici potest.
Eam enim per Metaphoram dividere dicitur, qui
plura ejus significata recenset3 nam in uno multa
distinguit. Ita qui animal dicit esse (i. e. voca-
bulum animal signficare) hominem et brutum,
dicitur animal in hominem brutumque dividere.
Quare Divisiok, est distincta enumeratio plurium,

k Division was employed by Plato and others as a method
of demonstrating definitions. Aristotle shews that the rea-
soning is unsound, and always involves a petitio principii. For
this reason he calls it a kind of weak syllogism, though he
allows it to be useful for testing definitions when gained: see
Appendix, note G. Among the later Peripatetics‚ Division
seems to have been held in higher estimation; a separate
treatise on the subject having been composed by Andronicus
Rhodius. From them it descended to Boethius, whose book
de Divisione is the principal authority from which subsequent
Logicians have drawn.

According to Boethius, the word Division is used in three prin-
cipal senses. l. Division of a genus into species. Q. Division
of a whole into parts. 3. Division of an equivocal term into
its several significations. Of these, according to Cicero, Top.
ch. 6. the first is properly called Divisio, the second, Pau-citio.
“ In partitione quasi membra sunt3 ut· corporis, caput, humeri,
manus, latera, crura, pedes, et cetera: in divisione, formae sunt,
quas Grreci ideas vocant; nostri, si quihaec forte tractant, species
appellant.'' Of. Quintil. v. 10. vii. 1. In Division, the whole
01· its definition can be prcdicated of each part, as “Homo est
animal,'' “Homo est vivens sensibile.'' 111 Partition this can-
not be done. Boethius, however, includes under his second
head, not only the enumeration of the component parts of an
individual, but also that of the individuals contained under an
infima species. ‘⁴ Ut cum dico domus aliud esse tectum, aliud
paries, aliud fumlainontuni; cumque hominis dicimus partes
esse Catonem, Virgilium, Ciceronem.'' The last in one respect
