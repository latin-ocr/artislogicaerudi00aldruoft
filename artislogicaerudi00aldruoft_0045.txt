gorIes‚ and concludes the first part with an account of
the supposition of ternis. The second part treats of
propositions‚ and the third of syllogisnis and fallacies.

Between Scotus and Occan] comes in order of time Raymond
the most eccentric genius of the scholastic period, Ray— Lully.
mond Lully. He is principally known as the author of
the Ars Mayna, by which he professed to teach a man
ignorant even of letters the whole encyclopaedia in the
course of three months. This work is nominally logical,
but has little in common with thc Aristotelian Logic,
being principally a mechanical contrivance for connect-
ing different philosophical ternis with each othei-¹¹². But
in his Dialectica, Lully condescends to follow the
beaten nack, and has composed a clear and concise
synopsis of Logic‚ framed principally on that of Petrus
Hispanusu.

The writings of Occam, as well as those of Scotus, con-
tributed especially to raise Logic to the rank of a distinct
science, independent of its applied uses⁰. But they
approached it from opposite sides. The principles of
Occam, developed by modern philosophy, would lead us
to the Logic of Kant: those of Scotus, almost to the
Logic of Hegel. The science of the former would
acquire a clear and distinct object in the province of
Thought: that of the latter would gradually absorb all

else, as coextensive with Being. Occam is the last great Later

¹¹ An account of Lully's system m‘fl be found in Keckermann, P1wcoynz'tu,
ii. 2. 39. and in Gassendi, de Oriyine Loqicae, c. 8. See also Hanani,

M. Haureau appears to regard Scotus as the author of the distinction
between the onica doeens and utens ‚· which is not the case. Cf. Aquinas,
in iv. Alletaph. Lect. 4«. Indeed, it is substantially contained in the
διαλεκτικὴ χωρὶς πραγμάτων and ἐν χρήσει πραγμάτων of the Greek [nteiu
preters.
