r Accidental definition is composed of genus* and one or
more promi-ties. Accidents properly so called are expressly
rejected as useless in definition by Porphyry, Isag. 3. 15. and
by Boethius, Opera, p. 3, though admitted by some subsequent
authorities. Hence animal risibile would be a better example
than Aldrich's animal bipes implume. But the majority of
Logicians have very properly regarded accidental definition,
in any form, as no definition, but merely description. It does
not analyse the contents of a motion, but enumerates marks
by which one imlivz'dual may be distinguished from each other.
The same notion can have but one definitiom the same indi-
vidual may have many descriptions. Cf. Albert. l. c. Occam,
pt. i. ch. 27. Wyttenbach. Praecept. Logs. p. iii. c. v. ξ. 14.
Drobisch, ξ. 104.
⁵ Metaphysical definition‚ the only proper definition in the
strict sense of the term, being by genus and differentia, (or
more correctly by genus and differentis& see Top. i. 8, 3.
and above, p. 26, note s.) it will follow, that all definable
notions must be species. Hence summa syenem, which have no
differentiae, and inclividzcals, which are distinguished only by
accidents, aro not definable. See Arist. Mctaph. iv. 3, 6.

point between Aristotle and Locke, or rather Descartes, may
lm, reduced to a verba] question. Sec Appendix, note C.
