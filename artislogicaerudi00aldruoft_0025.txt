INTRonUCTION. xxi

The Definition of Socrates has also inore of a materia] Socratie
than a logical character. He continually distinguishes Definitxou.
between the essence and the qualities of a thing, and
insists on determining what a thing εἰς, rather than what
it resemblesg; a distinction afterwards repudiated by his
diseiple Antisthenes, who denied the possibility of real
definition. But Definition, as treated by Socrates, is a
cont-ribution, not to Logic, but to Metaphysies. It does
not analyse by the laws of pure thought the contents of
a given notion3 but endeavours to penetrate the real
essence of thingsh. The same may in some degree be
said of the Aristotelian treatment of Definition in the
Posterior Analytics.

In the imperfect Socratic SchOOIS, as they are sometimes Soeratio
called, Logic, so far as it was cultivated at all, appears to Schools.
have gone back to the frivolities of the Sophists, instead
of advancing from, or even retaining, the position gained
by Socrates. To Antisthenes, the founder of the Cynics,
are attributed two theories3 the one a direct reversa] of
the teaehing of Socrates3 the other an apparent return to
the sensational and verba] standard of Protagoras. The
first of these denied the possibility of ascertaining the
nature of any thing by definitioni: the second denied
the possibility of contradiction, and, by consequence, os
falsehood k. The captious' reasonings of the Sophists
also appear again, as has been already observed, in the
Megarian School, especially in its later developmenffl.
