209. APPENDIX.

among the five modes of this fallacy enumerated by
Aristotle, one is in form not distinguishable from the
legitimate Syllogism ⁴¹. Selecting this variety, as that by
which most of all the objection is to be sustained‚ we
will proceed to examine its peculiarities.

In the first place, it is manifestly necessary to a
Petitz'o Quaesitiz as the fallacy may more eorrectly be
called, that there should be a question proposed for
proof. And hence it was long ago acutely remarked by
Petrus Hispanus, that such a fallacy cannot be com-
mitted in a Syllogism of irzferencef. If, that is, the
truth of the premises is known beforehand, and the only
question is, what may we infer from them? there is no
necessity for beyyiny or assumption of any kind. It is
clear then, that not the Syllogism in general, but at
most only one particular application of it, can beg the
question.

But it may be answered, that the truth of such premises
never can be ascertained‚ but by a previous induction
embracing all particular cases, and that Syllogistic in-
ference is therefore at least futile, since the conclusion
drawn must be presumed to be already known. But
this answer itself assumes what has never yet been
satisfactorily proved, the dependence of all knowledge
of Universals on Induction. If axiomatic principles can
be acquired in any other way, one class of Syllogisms is
at least exempt from the charge g.
