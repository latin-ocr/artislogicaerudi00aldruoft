IS THE SYLLOGISM A PETITIO PRINCIPIIa?

The eagle of the Libyan fable was killed by an arrow
feathered from his own wing. The armoury of the
Logician has been fondly imagined to contain the fatal
weapon of his own destruction. But the champion
destined to wield it, if such there be, is somewhat tardy
in his forthcoming. More than one Sir Kay has essayed
the adventure of the sword3 the Arthur destined to
achieve it remains in all the mysterious dignity of a
Coming Man. In other words, many writers have suc-
ceeded in shewing their own ignorance of the nature of
the fallacy called Petitio Principiib: they have not been
equally successful in proving the invalidity of the
Syllogistic process.

Let us first endeavour to ascertain what the Petitio
Principii really is. The name is a blundering trans-
lation of the Aristotelian τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ (or τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς)
diversam: i. e. the assumption, not of the principle properly
so canedo, but, in some form or other, of the question
oriyinally proposed for proof. And it is remarkable, that

³ This charge against the syllogism may be traced back as far as Sextus
Empiricus. See Pyrrh. Hyp. ΙΙ. 195.

b Of the numerous absurdities gravely propounded by Logicians in
relation to this fallacy‚ perhaps the happiest is the exquisite etymology of
Du Marsais, Loqique, p. 81. “ Ge mot s’appelle pe'tition de principe, du mot
grec πέτομαι, qui signifie voler vers quelque chose, et du mot latin principium,
qui veut dire commencement; ainsi faire une pe‘tition de principe, c’est
reoourir en d'autres termes ὲ la meme chose que ce qui a d'abord ete mis
en question.”

θ “ Without entering on the various meanings of the term Principle‚
which Aristotle defines, in general, that from which any chiny exists, is
produced, or is known, it is sufficient to say, that it is always used for that
on which something else depends3 and thus both for an original law, and
for an original clemente· Sir W. Hamilton‚ Reid's Wm-ks, p. 761. Cf.
Arist. Metaph. IV. l, 3.
