eleventh. From the middle of the eleventh century
may be dated the rise of the Scholastic Philosophy
properly so called.

The body of Arabian Commentators derive their ap-
pellation from the language in which they wrote: their
places of residence were various, and none of them
within the limits of Arabia. In fact, the Arabian lite-
rature did not arise till after the conquests of the suc-
cessors of Mahomet had extended the Saracen empire
far beyond the boundaries of their original country.
Like the later Greek Logffiians, the Arabians contribut-ed
little original matter to the science 3 their principa] works
being either translations, made sometimes from the
Greek but more frequently from the earlier Syriae
versions‚ or abridgments and commentaries. Of these
the most important are the logical abridgments of
Avicenna and Algazel, and especially the voluminous
translations and commentaries of Averroes. A Latin
version of the translations of Averroes, made from a
Hebrew one, was the principa] source from which the
earlier Schoolmen derived their knowledge of all the
writings of Aristotle} except his logical works, which
had been translated by Boethius. This barbarous ver—
sion continued in use even after a more accurate trans-
lation from the original Greek had been made by
William of Moerbecke, under the direction of Thomas
Aquinas. The merits of Averroes as a commentator
have been variously cstimated. Ludovicus Vives speaks
of him with great contempt. “Nomen est commentatoris
nactus, homo qui in Aristotele enarrando nihil minus
explicat quam eum ipsum quem suscipit declarandum.''
With this may bc contrasted the culogy of Keckermann.
“ Nemo tam veterum interpretum videri potest proximus
Aristotelis menti atque hic Arabs.'’ The modern critic
will probably talu· a middle csmrsf· between tho two.
