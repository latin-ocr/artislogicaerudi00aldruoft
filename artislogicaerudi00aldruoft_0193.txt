RUDIMENTA. 109

rumque duo (etsi interdum plura) proponit adver-
sario capienda; quorum utrumvis acceperit, causa
cadet. Tale est-illud Biantis, Si uxorem ducas
formosam, habebis κοινὴν, communem ,· si deformem,
ποινὴν, poenom .· ergo Nulla est ducenda ¹³.

lHoc non valet, nisi ita comparetur, ut partem
alteram accipi sit necesse; utraque autem feriat3
nec possit retorqueri. Quae si vidisset Bias, suo
sibi Dilemmate minus placuisset3 neque enim vel
formosa uxor vel deformis necessario futura est3

sed est media quaedam pulchritudo, quarn Ennius

III. Destructive, (always CompleX.)

IfAisB‚CisD; andifEisR GisH;
But either G is not D, or G is not H;
Either A is not B, or E is not F.

There cannot be a simple destructive Dileinma of this kind,
as is shewn by Abp. Whately‚ Logic‚ b. ii. ch. 4. ξ. 5.

There is another form of reasoning, sometimes called
Dilemma, which is also a hypothetico-disjunctive reasoning,
but which, instead of having the major premise hypothetical
and the minor disjunctive, has both combined in the major;
the whole of the disjunctive consequents being denied in the
minor. E. g. ‘⁴ If A is B, either C is D, or E is F; but
neither C is D, nor E is F; therefore A is not B.'’ This
form is given by Wallis, lib. iii. cap. 19.; as well as by Wolf
and Kant. But it is a perversion of the Dilemma proper, and
introduces no distinction whatever; being merely a common
disjunctive syllogism, as is shewn by Wallis himself. It is,
in fact, the enumeratio, not the complexio, of Cicero.

¹³ See Gellius, Noct. Att. v„ 11.

¹ These remarks entirely relate to the matter, and have

nothing to do with the Logical character, of the Dilemma.
See Whately‚ ii. 4. 5.
