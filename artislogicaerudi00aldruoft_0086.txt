]. Simplex ApprelzensiO, est nudus rei con-
ceptus intellectivuse, similis quodammodo per-
ceptioni sensitivaed; sicut enim Imago rei est in

divisio, nisi simplicium apprehensorum. Secunda vero ordi-
natur ad tertiam: quia videlicet oportet quod ex aliquo vero
cognito, cui intellectus assentiat, procedatur ad certitudinem
accipiendam de aliquibus ignotis. Cum autem Logica dicatur
rationalis scientia, necesse est quod ejus consideratio versetur
circa ea, quae pertinent ad tres praedictas operationes rationis.’'
Aquinas in Periherm. Lect. l. Cf. Opusc. xlviii. Tract. de Syll.
cap. 1. The passage alluded to by Aquinas is De An. iii. 6. 1.
ἡ μὲν οὖν τῶν ἀδιαιρέτων νόησις ἐν τούτοις περὶ ἃ οὐκ ἔστι τὸ ψεῦδος·
ἐν οἷς δέ τὸ ψεῦδος καὶ τὸ ἀληθές, σύνθεσίς τις ἤδη νοημάτων ὥσπερ ἓν
ὄντων, Ἀδιαίρετα are either ἀριθμῷ ΟΥ εἴδει. Metaph. iX. 1. 4.
The latter only are νοητά, the former αἰσθητά. Cf. Anal. Post. i.
24. ll.

⁰ Simple Apprehension, in the only sense in which it can
have any connection with Logic, is an operation of Thouyht,
and is more properly called conception. It is necessary to
distinguish Thought‚ which is representative, and whose
immediate object is an universal φιοῐὶοη, gained by comparison
and indifferently applicable to many individuals, from the
various intuitive faculties, which are presentata-e, and whose
immediate object is an individua thing, act, or state of mind,
existing without or within ourselves. This distinction is
properly psychologicaL but must be carefully borne in mind
in reference to the logical character of Thought. A fuller
explanation is given in Povleyomena Loyiea, Ghap. I.

d Among various intuitive faculties, it is necessary to dis-
tinguish between sensatam, Perception, and Itnaglination. The
two former are distinguished by Stewart, Outlines of Moraz
Philosophy, ξ. 15. “ Sensation expresses merely that change
in the state of the mind which is produced by an impression
upon an organ of sense; of which change we can conceive the
mind to be conscious without any knowledge of external
objects. Tho word Perception expresses the knowledge we
obtain, by means os our sonsations, of the qualities of matter.'’
