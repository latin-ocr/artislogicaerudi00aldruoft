² The logical, as distinguished from the grammatical pro-
position, is properly of the form distinguished as tertii
adjacentis, and the copula is always in the present tense.
For Logic considers words only as the signs of thought: and
the copula indicates the present union of two notions in the
mind of the thinker, not the past or future connection of
facts narrated or predicted. Every proposition should there-
fore, before conversion‚ be stated in the form Α is Β, which
by conversion becomes B is A, with a change, if necessary,
in the quantity. To give more minute directions would be
to encroach upon the province of the Grannnarian: we must
be guided by the idion] of the language we are using. In
Latin, e. g. the substantive acquires an adjective power, and
the adjective a substantive, without change of form; e. g.
“nullus sapiens est iracundus,” “nullus iracundus est sa-
piens.” In English we must say, “ No angry man is wise.''
Rules on this point are extra-logical.

The directions of some Logicians as to the conversion of
past and future time, e. g. “ nullus senex erit puer,’' are also,
logically speaking, out of place here, though practically helps
to a beginner. For these tenses not being logical copulae,
the sentence is not, as it stands, a logical proposition; and
should be reduced to such, before it comes into the hands of
the converter.

ἃ Aristotle’s account of conversion differs somewhat from
this. He divides conversion into universal and particular,
according to the quantity of the proposition after conversion.
Consequently E is converted universally, A and I particularly.
He does not recognise any conversion of O. Simple con—
version, (ἁπλῆ ἀντιστροφὴ,) is mentioned by Philoponus, Scholia,
p. 148. b. 2¹. Boethius uses the ternis qemi-alis and per ac-
cidens. In the system of Sir W. Hamilton‚ by assigning a
quantity to the predicate of every proposition, the various
kinds of conversion are reduced to that of simple conversion
alone.
