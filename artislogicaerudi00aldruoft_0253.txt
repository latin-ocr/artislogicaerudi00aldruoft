APPENmX. 169

with a spherica] triangle, “having three sides'' is common
to both3 the distinction being, that the sides in the one
case are straight lines, in the other, arcs of great circlesn.
But when one only of the compared notions is employed
as the subject of a proposition, and a portion of the
attributes which it comprehends is predicated of it, that
predicate cannot properly be called Genus or Differentia,
the comparison from which these distinctions arise having
ceased.

With this proviso, we may adopt, mutatis mutandis,
the classification of the Predicables given by Aristotle
himself, as furnishing a more satisfactory groundwork
than either the Isagoge of Porphyry or its subsequent
scholastic embellishments. Every Proposition, accord-
ing to Aristotle, expresses one of four relations of the
Predicate to its Subject3 Genus, (under which may be
included Differentia,) Definition, Property, or Accident0.
For every Predicate must either be convertible with its
Subject or not. If convertible, it either expresses the
whole Essence (τὸ τί ἧν εἶναι) of the Subject or not. In
the former case it is called Definition, in the latter,
Property. If not convertible, it either expresses part of
the Essence or not. In the former case it is Genus, in
the latter, Accident.
⁴ This division, being founded on dichotomy by contra-
diction, must necessarily exhaust every possible mode of
Predication. Interpreting the Essence, in accordance
with our present vieW, as the sum of the attributes

ed. Erdmann, p. 304. Schsreiben an Waqner, ibid. p. 425.

⁰ See Topics, i. 8. Sundry attempts have been made, not very success-
fully‚ to reconcile this account with that of Porphyry. But though some
license of interpretation may be allowed, when the object is to reconcile
an author with himself, it is scarcely necessary to strain his language into
agreement with a writer who lived more than six centuries after him, and
who does not even profess to be commenting on him.
