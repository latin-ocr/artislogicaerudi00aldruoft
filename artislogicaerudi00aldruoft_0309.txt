ΑΡΡΕΝΒΙΧ. 2⁶25

Deinde illud cujus confirmandi causa fiet Inductio, viden-
dum est ut simile iis rebus sit, quas res, quasi non
dubias, ante induxermu313' Quintilian, however, applies
the term rather to the brinyz'nq in, as an inference‚ of
the question to be proved. “ Nam illa, qua plurimum
Socrates est usus, hanc habuit viam; cum plura inter-
rogasset, quae fateri adversario necesse esset, novissime
id, de quo quaerebatur, inferebat, cui simile concessisset3
id est inductiom.'⁷ Another meaning of the Greek ἐπάγειν
and ἐπαγωγός, as well as of the Latin inducere and in-
ductio, might seem to point rather to the persuading and
influencing the mind of the hearerfl. But the first de-
rivation is preferable. The question, however, as far as
Aristotle is concerned, is not of any great consequence.
For, as that Philosopher did not invent the name, but
only modified the usage of a term current among his
predecessors, the etymology will be of little service
towards illustrating the notion which he attached to it.
