INTRODUCTION. xxvii

the fivefold classification of the PredicableS, adopted by
most subsequent Logicians. thether this classification
is an improvement on, or consistent with, the Aristote—
lian doctrine, admits of considerable questiong.

The Greek Abridgments of Aristotle, though in pointGregzk
of chronology they extend below the scholastic period,fflg}{15'
are in matter rather connected with the preceding series
of Commentators. While the Scholastic Logic began
in the extreme west of Europe, the Greek Logicians of
this class belong entirely to the extreme east, or to
Asia. John of Damascus, in the early part of the eighth Joannes
century, made a brief analysis of the Isagoge ofgssfflss]
Porphyry and of the Categories, and is remarkable as
one of the first who applied Logic to Theology. Photius, Photius.
the learned and turbulent Patriarch of Constantinople
in the ninth century, was the author of abridgments of
the Categories and the Dc Interpretatione. Michael
Psellus the younger, in the eleventh century, composed Psellus.
a Synopsis of the Gategories and of Porphyry's Intro-
duction. To Psellus has also been attributed a Synopsis
of the Organon, published by Ehinger in 1597, the
contents of which correspond almost to a word with
those of the celebrated Latin text book of the thirteenth
and following centuries‚ the Summulae Loyicales of
Petrus Hispanus. The latter work has been by the
majority of critics regarded as a translation of the
former3 but there are some difficulties connected with
this view which have not as yet been satisfactorily

disposed ofb. The most remarkable work of this kind

¹¹ That Hispanus is a mere translator of Psellus is maintained by
Keckermann, by Eume, and reeently by Prantl. On the other hand, Sir
W. Hamilton (Disczaessz'otzs, pp. 128, 673.211‹1 ed.) is of opinion that the Greek
is a translation from the Latin, and of course erroneously attributed to
Psellus. The strongest argument in favour of the former opinion is the
remarkable sac-t, recently discovered by Pmntl, of the existence in manu-
