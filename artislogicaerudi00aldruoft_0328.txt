244 APPENDIX.

the cause of the conclusion, is not the first cause, (in
which ease the syllogism is not ἐξ ἀμέσωνθ,) or if the
premise be an effect and not a cause of the conclusion,
or if the promise, though immediate, be a remote and
not a proximate cause of the conclusion,—under these
circumstances, there is no Demonstration, in the proper
sense of the term, as we only know the fact, but not the
cause‘.

From the above data, the scholastio successors of
Aristotle have constructed the following specimen of
demonstratio potissima⁴>

Omne wnimal rationale est risibile ,-
Omnis homo est animal rationale: ergo

Omnis homo est risibilis,

ln this syllogism all three propositions are per 865
the major premise and the conclusion in the second
mannen for the subject homo, and consequently ani-mal
rationale, forms part of the definition of the attribute
risibile: the minor premise is per se in the first manner3
for animal rationale, its predicate, is the definition of
homo.

In all the propositions of this Demonstration, the
predicate and subject are coextensive, and the pro-

e From this it may fairly be inferred that the demonstratio propter quicl
si! per causum mm primam, would not alone be regarded by Aristotle as a
Demonstration, though it may form a subordinate portion of a complex
Demonstration. The ambiguity os the word ἅμεσσς, which has partly led
to the disci-epmmies on this point, has been explained before. See p. 121.

f See Anal. Post. i. 13. The distinction between demenso-ateio propter
quid potissimo and mm potissima cannot fairly bc attributed to Aristotle.
The whole os tho chapters of the first book os the Posterior Analytjcs,from
tho first to the thirtecnth inclusive, trcat of one kind os Demonstration
only. The passages in the second. book, (ch. 17 and 18.) which seem to
favour ilic distinction, are trenting only of tho inferior sense of Demon-

stration, in whivh it is applicable to ’τὰ πεφυκότα ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολύ. Cf. Anal.
