'¹ On the history of the ternis Objcct and Sulrject, Objectt've
and Summave, see Sir W. Hamilton's noto, Itct'd's Worlcs,
p. 806. and 'Prendelenburg Elementa, ξ. 1. The variatione
between the Scholastic and the modern 561150 of these ternis
are however in this particular relation unimportant. VVhere
knowleclye or certainty is spoken of, the subject of inherence
(in the scholastic 501150) 15 the mind as knowing; and the
object proper 15 the thing as known; and thus far, the
modern use of the same tei-ms is nearly coincident; though
when viewed out of relation to the act of knowledge, the two
nomenclatures are exactly the reverse of each other. In our
present point of view we may distinguish certitudo objecti as a
quality os tlte proposition as apprehendet by the mind, ancl certi-
tudo subjecti as ιι state of tlte mind as apprehendens] the promentem
and in this sense the two are inseparable from each other,
being only the 'same act of thought viewed from opposite
sides. This is the only sense of object and subject with
which Logic has any concern. The subjective existence, as the
schoolmen would call it, or the objective existence, as the
moderns would call it, of things out of the act of thought,
belongs to a metaphysical inquiry, with which, as Logicians‚
we have no concern.
