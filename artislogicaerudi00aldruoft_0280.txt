certainty of the former, and the demonstrative character
of the whole reasoning, ultimately depends.

II. Logic has nothing to do With testing the material
correctness of a definition, i. e. ascertaining how far the
notions developed in our analysis of a given concept
correspond to the principa] phenomena exhibited by the
objects usually included under that concept3 nor even
with the inquiry, whether our usage of terms corresponds
with the ordinary language of others.

ΙΙΙ. Stil] less does it lie within the province of Logic
to perform the functions either of a Dictionary or of an
Index to Physica] Science3 to convey, that is, information
from without, whether concerning the meaning of words
or the nature of things, into a mind previously ignorant.
Whereas, from the statements of some Logicians, one
might almost imagine that they regarded their Science
as furnishing, as it were, Logarithmic Tables of things in
general, Catalogues of Genera and Differentiae, to which
we have only to refer any given object, to obtain full
information concerning it0.

These being excluded, the only office that remains for
Logic to perform, is to contribute to the distinctness of a
given concept, by an analysis and separate exposition of
. the different parts contained within it. This operation is

0 Thus Melanchthon, Erotemata Dialectices, p. 109. ed. 1568. “ Cum
quaerimus definitionem inspiciuntur tabulae praedicamentorum. Unde disces
an res, de qua dicturus es, sit substantia an accidens. Et si est accidens,
in qua parte sit, in corpore an in anima, &c.” And so Keekermann, Syst.
Loy. M in. lib. i. cap. 17. “ In hunc enim usum istae rerum tabulae et
delineationes praecipue illie adumbrantur, ut definitum quaeratur, simulque
animo lustretur, quid ex parte superiori proxime definito adjaceat: id
enim erit ejus Genus: e. g. cupio conficere definitionem Hominis: cogito
ergo primum in quo praedicamento sit Homo, et deprehendo ex notis
Substantiae, esse in praedicamento Substantiae: quocirca tabulam hujus
praedicamenti perlustrans animo, deprehendo hominem proxime collocari
sub animali: hine concludo hoc esse proximum ejus genus. Sic in aliis
proceditur definitis per singula praedieamenta.”
