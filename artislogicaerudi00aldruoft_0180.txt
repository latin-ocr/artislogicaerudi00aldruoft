ubi quod ponitur de singulari noto, assumitur de
simili ignoto: ut, Sylla et Marius laceravere rem-
publicam ; ergo C'oesar et Pompeius lacerabunt.

to this view, will be, ‘¹ Caesar and Pompey are Sylla and
Marius.'' But the example proper is not a logical reasoning
at all3 being a compound of an imperfect, and therefore
illogical, Induction and a Syllogisni. See further, Appendix,
note H.

¹ The Sorites is a series of propositione, in which the pre-
dicate of each is the subject of the next3 the conclusion being
formed of the first subject and the last predicate. It may be
expanded into a series of syllogisms in the first figure, the
conclusion of each being the minor premise of the next.
There will be as many syllogisms as there are intermediate
propositione between the first premise and the conclusion;
the first being the only minor premise stated. Hence there
ean only be one particular premise in a Sorites, the first ; the
others being major premises in the first figure. And the last
is the only premise which may be negative: for any previous
negative premise would produce a negative conclusion, which
could not be used as a minor premise in the next syllogism.

The Sorites is not recognised as a distinct kind of reason-
ing by Aristotle. Nor is there any reason why it should have
been; as it is merely a combination of ordinary syllogisms,
succinctly expressed. Its distinct exposition is attributed to the
Stoics. But the principle, as Melanchthon observes, is implied
in Categ. 3. l. and the Sorites itself is alluded to in Anal. Pr.

i. 25. 2, ll. There is another form of the Sorites‚ called the
v reyressive or Goelenian, first given by Goelenius in his Isayoye
in Oryasmmz Aristotelis, 1598, p. 255. In this, the subject of each
proposition is the predicate of the next; the conclusion being
