vol. i. p. 384. On the other hand, Sir W. Hamilton, in a
very interesting paper in the second edition of his Discussions,
p. 666. maintains the opinion of Pacius, and proposes a re-
storation of the Aristotelian diagrams. This dissertation
contains a fund of valuable matter on the history and phi-
losophy of Logic, which will well repay a careful perusal.
Aristotle acknowledges only three figures ; looking rather to
the extension of the middle term, as compared with the other
two, than to its position in the two premises. In this point
of view there are only three figures possible; for the relative
extensions of the major and minor terms being given, the
middle can only have three positions; between the other
two, as in the first figure3 greater than both, as in the
second; or less than both, as in the third. See Trendelen-
burg, Elem. ξ. 28. Waitz on Anal. Pr. i. 23. 7. The invention
of the fourth figure is attributed by Averroes (on Anal. Pr.
i. 8.) to Galen. The latter may possibly have first called the
five moods by that name, but they were known at a much
earlier period as indirect moods of the first figure. An in-
direct mood is one in which we do not infer the immediate
conclusion, but its converse. Consequently, the predicate
of the conclusion, which in a direct mood is the major term,
is in an indirect one the minor. The five indirect moods
of the first figure were called Baralip, Celantes, Dabitis,
Fapesmo, Frisesnm. The three first are clearly Barbara,
Celarent, Darii, with the conclusions converted. With regard
to the two last, the process is a little more intricate. They
have negative minor promises, and thus offend against a
