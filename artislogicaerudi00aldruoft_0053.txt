Raisonnement, the rules of the syllogism are reduced to
a single principle, that which is in the contained is in the
containiny. This formula, an important step towards
the true law of syllogism, the Principle of Identity, is
perhaps originally due to Leibnitzf. Buffier has had
the good fortune to receive high praise from two very
opposite quarters, and on very different grounds. He
has been celebrated, on the one hand, as one of the
earliest who attempted to found philosophy οι] certain
prim-ary truths, given in certain primary sentiments or
feelings3 and, on the other hand, as having advanced
some important steps in the direction of the sensa-
tionalisin of Condillacg.

Le (llere, (Joannes Clericus) the friend and disciple Le Clere.
of Locke‚ published his Logic in 1692, three years after
the first edition of Locke's Essay, of which he had
previously seen the Epitome. This work is principally
based on the views of Locke, with some additions from
the Port Royal Logic‚ and the Recherche de la verite
of Malebranche. The fourth book, on Argumentation,
does not materially differ from the Aristotelian view,
though, like Locke, he has not a high opinion of the
syllogiffln, and considers it to be, mainly an instrument
of disputation. He adds a chapter on the Socratic
method of discussion, which he considers more valuable
than the Aristotelian syllogism. The Logic and Meta-
physics of 'S Gravesande, published in 1736, is highly 'S Grave<
praised by M. St. Hilaire, as simplifying with greatsande'
elearness the ancient Logic‚ in connection with the
principles of Locke. The doctrines of Locke, modified
by Cartesianism, had also considerable infiuence on the
Logic of lVatts‚ in which a somewhat incongruous union Watts.
