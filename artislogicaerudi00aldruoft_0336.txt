mathematica] necessity becomes identified with logical,
being only the result of the harmony of a process of
thought with its original assumption. This consequence
is accepted by Stewart himself, as well as by Archbishop
Whately, who speaks of the denial of geometrieal pro-
positions as seff-contradictorgy''.

This view may be refuted either directly or by a
reductio ad absurdum; for, firstly, it rests on an un-
tenable assertion3 secondly, it leads to an inadmissible
consequence.

Firstly. If the properties of a figure follow from the
definition of that figure, it must either be because they
are implied in some (me attribute of that definiti0n‚ or
because they are implied in the whole. A triangle e. g.
will have its angles equa] to two right angles, either
because it is a rectilinear figure, or because it is of three
sides, or because it is both. The two first suppositions
are manifestly false: the third begs the questi0n3 for
why the notion of a triangle, regarded as a complex
whole, has this property, is the very point at issue.

Hence it appears that the Definitions of Geometry, so
far as they are employed in demonstration, are merely
nominal. From the analysis of the complex notion no
conclusion is derived. The Definition only serves to
connect the notion as a whole with the name trianylec.

ἲ) This view is also adopted by M. Cousin in liis Lectures on Kant,
apparently as an exposition of the opinion os Kant himself, to which
however it is diuni‹.⁴t1=ically opposed.

ι’ This view is supported by the authority of one equally eminent as a
philosopher and a mathematician. Pascal (Penszfes, P. Ι. Art. 11. vol. i.
p. 1⁴26. ed. Faugere) observes,“ On no reconnait en geometrie que les
