the mathematics, is not true of any succession of physical
phenomena. As a matter of fact, we experience that certain
events are invariably conjoined‚ but there is not, as in mathe-
matical demmstrations, any necessity that they must be so.
Invariable succession, in fact, is the highest positive notion
of causality to which we can attain in the case of sensible
phenomena, though this limitation does not include the moral
causality of which we are conscious in volition. Necessity,
however, in any sense is untenable as a logical criterion of
property, since it presupposes an acquaintance with the laws
of any given physical phenomena, of which the Logician
as such knows nothing. A better logical distinction between
property and accident is that given by Aristotle, of the con-
vertible and non convertible attribute. See Appendix, note A.
