sive de quo aliud dicitur. 2. Proeclicatum, sive id

s The Latin Logicians distinguish between propositions
secundi adjacentis, in which the copula and predicate form one
word, e. g. “Homo cu1·r'1t‚'’ and propositions tertii adjacentis,
in which they are separated, e. g. ‘⁴ Homo est animal.” The
distinction originates with Aristotle, see De Im. 10. 3. But
Aristotle does not maintain that propositions of the former
kind are to be resolved into the latter. On the contrary, the
early part of the De Interpretatione is adapted exclusively to
propositions secundi adjace72tis; and in order to make it ap—
plicable to such propositions as ‘⁶ Homo est animal,'' we must
consider the copula and predicate as equivalent to a single
verb ³.

t In Alclrich's limitation of the terms, Γαῖ’ simplex, Vox
cccce90›·e2natica‚ and Terminus simplex, are syuonymous: syn-
categorcnis not being voces (logicae) at all. But in this
usage he is not always consistent.

⁰ In De Int. ]. 4. it seems at first sight as is λευκὸν alono was a ῥῆμα,
'rhat this is not the case is clear from Poetics, 20. 9. τὸ μὲν ’γὰρ ἅνθρωπος
ἢ λευκὸν οὐ σημαίνει τὸ πότε, τὸ δὲ βαδίζει ἢ βεβάδικε προσσημαίνει τὸ μὲν
τὸν παρόντα χρόνον τὸ δὲ τὸν παρεληλυθότα. In saci, λευκόν, by a common
‹ires-k idiom, is cquivalent to λευκόν ἐστι.
