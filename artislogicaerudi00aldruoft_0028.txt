matters, which a more accurate classification of the
sciences would relegate to Metaphysics, to Psychology,
to Rhetoric, or to Grammar. But Aristotle must not be
considered as responsible for the present composition of
the Organon, but only for six distinct treatises, which
his commentators have combined into one volumet. Of
these, the latter part of the De Interpretatione and the
Prior Analytics may be regarded as containing most of
the essential parts of pure Logic; though, as regards the
laws and forms of judgment in some degree, and of
conception almost entirely, much must be added and
much retrenched, before we can bring the entire pro-
ducts of pure thought into harmony with the elaborate
development of the various forms of the syllogism. The
treatise on the Cateyorz'eS, with the early part of the De
Daterpretatione, is grammatica] rather than logical, with
a few trespasses on the domain of Metaphysics; while
the Posterior Analyticm, together with the Topics and
Sopltistz'c Refutations, contain applications of Logic to
necessary and contingent matter in demonstration and
dialectic disputation, and should be accurately classed
rather as parts of the Loffl'ea utem than of the Loyica
docem. But we are notjustified in criticising the Organon
of Aristotle as though it were a single work composed on
a single subject.

Of the post-Aristotelian Logicians, my limits will only
allow a very brief notice. To Theophrastus is attributed
the invention of the Hypothetical Syllogism‚ which was
afterwards more sully developed by Eudemus and the
