‘⁶ The error,'' continues Sir W. Hamilton, “ would be
of comparatively little consequence, did it not induce
a perfunctory consideration of the laws of those faculties
of thought3 these being viewed as only subsidiary to
the process of reasoning.'’ Of the truth of this charge
there can be no question. A student might read
through nearly every one of the popular treatises on
Logic, without finding the slightest hint of the fact, that
in the processes of conception and judgment, as well as
in that of reasoning, there is a distinction to be made
between the form of the thought and the matter, the
former being equally in all three processes accurately
and completely determinable by logical rules3 the latter
being equally in all three beyond the domain of the
science. A thought may violate its own laws, and thus
virtually destroy itself3 or it may be perfectly consistent
with itself, but at variance with the facts of experience.
The result in the one case is a product logically ille-
gitimate, or the untln'nlcable, in the other the empirically
illegitimate, or mzreal.

In both cases alike the mind is supposed to be
already in possession of the necessary data for thinking
at all. Wliere there is a material deficiency in the
conditions preliininary to an act of thought, we cannot
be said to think logically or illogically3 for we cannot
attempt to think at all. Thus, if we are told to conceive
objects which have never been presented in their
proper experience, a colom· for instance which we have
never seen, or a sccnt which we have never smelt3 or
is we are required to form a judgment, other than iden-
tical, with less than two concepts, or a syllogism with
less thau two prelnises, we are in the position of a
builder without materials‚ who can neither obey nor
