sistent, if pushed to their ultimate consequences, with its
main positions.

In treating the doctrine of Predicablesâ€š two alter-
natives are open to the modern Logician. Either he
may take the scholastic language as he finds it, and
explain it with reference to the theories on which it
was originally founded3 warning, however, at the same
time his readers or hearers, that the supposed Real
Essences are deserving of the same amount of belief
as the Deities of Heatheu Mythology, or the Sylphs,
Gnomes, and Salamanders of the Rosicrucians3 or he
may adopt a theory of Universals in conformity with
views current in modern philosophy, and remodel the
whole account of the predicables, so as to make it
consistent therewith. But any attempt at a compromise
between the two, any explanation of ancient language
upon modern hypotheses, can produce nothing but in-
consistency in the Teacher and confusion in the Pupil.
In the first place, such explanation, even where most
satisfactory, is founded merely on analogy, and hence
will rather shew what the doctrines expounded ought
to have been, according to modern criticism, than what
they actually were. In the second place, the analogy
in some important particulars will fail entirely, and
the exceptional cases must either by some unnatural
distortion be forced under the given classification, or
be excluded altogether, to the serious detriment of the
completeness of the theory.

To adopt then the first mode of explanation. We will
suppose that Genera and Species are substances, having
a real existence independently of us, and cognisable as
to their nature, no matter how, by the human mind. Of
these universal substanceS, some are more extensive,
others less so, the limits at both extremities being fixed
by nature, and the numbers in each degree settled and
