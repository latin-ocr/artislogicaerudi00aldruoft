that its object is not the three operations of the reason,
but the syllogismi. His commentaries bear out his
cognomen, consisting for the most part of minute dis-
tinctions, suggested by the text of his author, with argu-
ments on both sides precisely stated, and distinctions
drawn to the extreme of subtlety. Scotus, like Aquinas,
was a Realist, and the more consistent of the two. He
held that the universal existed in the individual, not
really, as his predecessor had taught, but formallyk.
Hence the rival seets of Thomists and Scotists, the latter
of whom ultimately adopted the name of For-malists.
Both agreed, however, in opposition to Nominalism.
From the school of Scotus, however, arose the great
reviver of Nominalism, William Occam, the Invincible
Doctor, the ablest writer in Logic whom the Schools
have produced. His doctrine, like that of Abelard, was
really Conceptualisml. The Summa totius Loyz'coe of
Occam is the most valuable contribution of the middle
ages to the Loyica docens. If we do not subscribe to the
hyperbole of his editor, Mark of Beneventum, who,
borrowing from the well-known eulogy of Plato, declares
that if the Gods used Logic, it would be the Logic of
Occam, we may fairly allow, with M. St. Hilaire, that it
is the clearest and most original of the works of that
period. Occam, like Petrus Hispanus, departs from the
ordinary arrangement of treating consecutively the lsa-

goge of Porphyry and the several books of the Organon.
He commences with the different divisions of termS, of

which his account is much more complete than that of
the Summulae Loqz‘cales, He then proceeds to the pre-
dicables, introduced by a defence of the nominalist view
of universals, then to definition, division, and the cate-
