228 APPENDIX.

On the other hand, the Example has a strictly logical
value, when it is used, not as an independent reasoning,
but as an answer to objections. Thus it does not loqically
follow, because A and B are both X, and A is Y, that B is
also Y. But the union of X and Y in the instance of A
Zoyically-proves that X and Y are not incompatible with
each other 3 that one X at least is Y, and therefore that the
two attributes may coexist in the same subject. Hence
the Example is logically valid against any reasoner who
maintains that a thing cannot be Y, because it is X. But,
in this case, the conclusion is not assertorial, “ B is Y,”
but only problematical, “ B may be Y.”

The Example is sometimes loosely called reasoning
from Analoyyg. This term, however, properly belongs
not to absolute similarity in any given quality, but only
to similarity of relations. Thus Aristotle speaks of an
analoyy between sight and intellect‚ the one being re-
lated to the body as the other to the soulh. And the
argument of Bishop Butler's Aozaloyy of Reliyion to tlte
Constitution and Course of Nature may be put into the
same form. The difficulties in Religion, natural and
revealed, have the same relation to their respective
systems, that the difficulties in the course of nature have
to the entire system of nature. If then the latter be
admitted to proceed from a Divine Author, the* diffi-
culties in the two former are not a valid objection
against a like origin. This reasoning from Analogy
corresponds to what is sometimes called the Induc-
tion of SocrateS, and to the παραβολὴ mentioned in
Aristotle's Rhetorici. Like the Example proper, it
