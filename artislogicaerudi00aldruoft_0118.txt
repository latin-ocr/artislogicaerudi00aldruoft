34 ARTIS LoclcAE

dicitur: vel Specfficum, quod fluit ab essentia
speciei infimae ε Illud itaque de pluribus speciebus,
hoc, de una specie et pluribus Individuis praedi-
catur. Exempla, Mobile et Risibile.

Proprium tamen aliunde quadrifariam diciturh.

Speciei, sed non omni ejus Individuo; ut homini

substances and at all times. Such properties of the summum
genus are enumerated by Aristotle, Categ. ch. 5. These
were in the scholastic theory regarded as flowing from the
simple essence; those of all subordinate classes from the
differentia.

¹¹ Porphyry, following Aristotle, does not distinguish Pro-
perty from Accident as flowing necessarily from the essenee,
but as coextensive and simply eonvertible with its subject.
In this he is followed by Boethius: the other distinction, how-
ever, appears as early as in the commentary ofAlbertus Magnus,
and seems to have been derived from the Arabians. (Cf. Albert
de Predicab. T ract. vi. cap. l.) The ἴδιον of Porphyry answers
to the fourth kind of property mentioned in the text. The
other three are accidents; the first and third separable; the
second inseparable, but still only an accident, as belng pre
dicable of more subjects than homo. On the scholastic theory,
it is also an accident, as not flowing necessarily from rationale,
the differentia. Aristotle, who defines man ζῷον πέζον δίπουν,
would regard bipes as a differentia. It may be observed that,
upon the principles of Aristotle and Porphyry, a generic
property can only be regarded as a property with respect to
the highest species of which it is predicable. As regards all
subordinate species, it must be considered as an accident.
Mobile, for example, a property of corpus, is an accident to
animal, and to homo, as not convertible with them. This may
be fairly inferred from Top. ii. 3, 5. and is also maintained by
Avicenna and Albertus Magnus: see Albert. de Predicab.
ΤΙ-ποῖ. ix. cap. Ι. 011 the theory of necessary connection, it may
romain a property but on this authorities are divided.
