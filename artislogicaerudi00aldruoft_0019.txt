Two names sanctioned by Aristotle are applicable to Names

Analytz‘c and Dialectic. The former term is applied by Analytic.
Aristotle to the four books which treat of the syllogisni
and of demonstrationi, and appears to denote the reso-
lution of the reasoning process into its scientific forms.
This word is the most nearly synonymous with the
modern Loyic of any used by Aristotle hirnself3 but it
embraces the process of Reasoning only, to the exclusion
of Conception and Judgmentk. Dialectic is a word pro· Dialectic.
bably invented by Plat01, though afterwards applied to
the works of earlier philosopherS, e. g. Zeno the Eleatic.
In its Platonic sense it denoted the highest of all
sciences3 that which takes cognisance of the eternal
and immutable‚ of being in general and its attributes,
and thus has insight into the universal principles upon
which all other knowledge is dependentm. [t thus
corresponds in matter, though different in form, with
the first Philosophy or Theology of Aristotle, afterwards
called Metaphysics. The name Dialectic had reference

ἱ Galen (de libris propriis, ch. ll.) says> that the title Analgstica is not
Aristotelian; the Prior Analytics being called by their author περὶ συλλο-
γισμοῦ, and the Posterior, περὶ ἀποδείξεως. This testimony is accepted by
M. St. Hilaire, Jlemoire, p. 42. But the name ἀναλυτικὰ occurs too
frequently in Aristotlc’s own writings to warrant this vieW, unless we
suppose (which is very improbable) that all the references have been
interpolated by a later hand. Cf. lVaitz, vol. i. p. 367. The distinction,
however, between Prior and Posterior Analytics is not recognised by
Aristode, and we may perhaps conjecture that the name ἀναλυτικὰ was
given by him to the entire four books, each division being also distin-
guished by its own title, as mentioned by Galen.

Ponticus ; though he does not give it the name of analysis.
