more resembles division proper; as the name and definition of
the whole are predicable of each part. But on account of the
infinite number of individuals‚ and consequent impossibility
of exhausting the species⁷ this is not generally reckoned as a
division proper.

The division of an equivocal term, as canis into animal,
sidus, piscis, is sometimes called Distzfnetion. The test of this
is, that the name is predicable of each member, but not the
same definition. This is useful sor separating the scnses of
an ambiguous term before defining it. See Top. vi. 2. 1.

¹ For the due observance of these rules, it is desirable that
the division consist of as few mcmbers as possible. Some
recommend dichotomy, or a division of every genus into two
species by means of opposed differentiae. Of the four kinds
of Opposition, Boethius admits for this purpose contraries,
positive and privative terms, and also contradictories as some-
times unavoidable3 but rejects relatives. Aristotle censures
the use of privative and indefinite tei-ms, and approves of
division by contraries. See Top. vi. 6. 3. de Part. Anim. i. 3.
Here dichotomy is only practicable when the contraries admit
no medium between them. Cf. Cat. 10, 18. Top. vi. 6. 1.
Examples of dichotomy by contraries may be found in the
Arbor Porphyriana. For a threefold division of the same kind,
see Eth. Nic. Vii. 6, 5. τῶν γὰρ ἡδέων ἕνια φύσει αἱρετά, τὰ δ’ ἐναντία
τούτων, τὰ δὲ μεταξύ. Dichotomy by contradiction, which Aristotle
censures, had been a favourite method with Plato, as it after-
wards was with Ramus and his followers. See Hamilton's
Reid, p. 689. Cf. Trend. Elem. ᾗ. 68, Erlauterungen‚ p. 106.

But none of the above methods of division can be regarded
as a strictly formal process of thought. Any concept A is
