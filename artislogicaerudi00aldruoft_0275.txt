that which is incapable of definition, and which in con-
sequence necessarily involves it's own failure. The same
may be said of the principa] opinion which Aristotle
controverts. thether we regard Pleasure, with Plato,
as consisting in a motion towards a natural state os
harmony, or with Aristotle, in the perfect exercise of a
power3 neither of these can be termed an explanation
of the feeling itself‚ but only of the cause by which it is
produced. Pleasure itself remains an indefinite some-
thing, consequent on the one or the other. Yet examined
according to Aristotle’s own view of the definition of
attributes, we see that pleasure is as fairly defined by
the perfection of the exercise of power, as an eclipse by
the interception of lightf.

There are, however, conditions and limits to the
definitions of Attributes, though they are not the same
as those of Substances. Every Substance to be definable
must be a Species. Every Attribute must be a Property,
i. e. must be capable of demonstration by its cause.
Accidents then, as merely contingent attributes, are
incapable os definition. This limitation‚ however, is
merely relative to the degree of our knowledge of the
matter. The advance of Science may transform Acci-
dents into Properties, and thus furnish the requisite
means of definition.

Before concluding the subject, it will be necessary to
say a few words on two other points connected with
Aristotle's doctrine of Definition.

‘Leibnitz adopts the same view as Aristotle, obserw'ng that pleasure
admits of a causal, though not of a 'nominat definition. Nonveaux Εεεαίε,
ii. 21. ξ. 46. In another point of view, simple ideas admit of a definition by
logical analysis; viz. when they are considered, not as phenomena presented
to the sense, to be resolved into simpler sensible phenomena, but as con-
cepts, or general notions, representative of objects of thought, to be resolved
into simplex· concepts. On this distinction Ι have remarked elsewhere.
