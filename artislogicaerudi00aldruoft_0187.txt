Propositio Hypothetica late sumta definitur, Plures
Categoricae per conjunctionem aliquam unitae, et
conjunctio vocatur Copula ; estque Conditionalis,
'Diejunctivm Causalis⁰ &c. ut apud Grammaticos3
unde totidem Hypotheticarum specieS, suis copulis
cognomines. Sed ad Syllogismum non faciunt,
Praeter conditionalem, et Disjunctivamffi quarum

Conditionalis habit vim illativam. Unde Con—
ditio ipsa, sive pars prior, quae est instar inferentis,
Antececlens dici solet; Assertio, sive pars posterior,
quae rationem habet illatae, Consequens ,· partiumque

ὃ Gaas-alis, e. g. “Because A is B, C is D.‘’ This is, of
course, only a hypothetical in the loose sense of the above
definition. In the same sense were admitted tempor-al hypo-

G is D‚‘' &o &a The causal hypothetical proposition is really
a curtailed hypothetical syllogism. “Because A is B, G is D,’'
is equivalent to “ If A is Β, G is D, and A is B.’' Cf. Hoff-
bauer, Loyik, ᾗ. 236.

‘¹ Nothing can be more clumsy than the employment of the
word conditional in a specific sense, while its Greek equivalent,
hypothetical, is used generically. In Boethius, both terms are
properly used as synonymous and generic3 the two species
being called conjunctivi, conjuncti, 01· connexi, and disjunctim,
or disjuncti. See Boethii Opera, p. 610, Hamilton's Discussions,
p. 150. The nomenclature of Boethius is followed by Ramus.
With reference to modern usage, however, it will be better
to contract the Greek word than to extend the Latin one.
Hypothetical‚ in the following notes, will be used as synony-
mous with conditional.

θ It has been questioned whether Hypothetical Syllogisms
can be reduced to Gategorical. This question must not be
