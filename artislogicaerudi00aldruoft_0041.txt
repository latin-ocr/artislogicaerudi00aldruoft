most of the scholastic logical treatises down to the

Towards the end of the twelfth century we comeJohp of

philosophy of the scholastic Logic, the Metaloyz‘cus
of John of Salisbury. The work purports to be a
defence of Logic, under which is included Grammar and
Rhetoric, against a sciolist of the day, to whom he gives
the name of Cornificius‘¹. It contains an interesting
account of the author's own preparation for dialectic
studies, notices of the origin of Logic, and a good
analysis of the Organon with criticisms. Among other
points, it is worthy of notice that he considers the
Aristotelian doctrine of the predicables, given in the
Topics, to be preferable to the common account, derived
from Porphyry. He highly praises Abelard3 and his
testimony is the more valuable, as he himself appears
to incline to the doctrines os the Realistse.

Some of these expositions M. Jourdain supposes to have been the books
condemned by the Council of Paris in 1210. Aristotle’s own physical and
metaphysieal writings were probably not translated till about the middle

‘¹ This name M. Hau1·<2au explains as follows. “ Oornifea:‚ Cornificius,
signifiera ‘celui qui fait des cor-nes! Mais de quelles cornes peut-il
§tre ici question ἶ) Sans doubt de ces cornua disputationis dont parlc encore
Ciceron3 ce qu'on appelle, en logique, les cornes d'un dilemme. A ce
compte, nos Cornificiens auraient ete d’aigres disputeurs, des logiciens
aceres, d'intraitables sophistes.’' Philosophie Sclzolasllque‚ p. 344. Prantl
on the other hand, with more probability, supposes that a historical name
has been figuratively applied, and traces the origin of the appellation to
the poet Cornificius, mentioned in Donatus’s Life of Virgil, c. xvii.
“ Cornificius ob perversam naturam illum non tulit.”

doubtful. See limaeam, vol⁴ i. p. 354.
