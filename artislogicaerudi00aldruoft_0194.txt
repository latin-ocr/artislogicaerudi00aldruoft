11‘23'15' potest. Puta, Si formosam dumero, non habebo
poenam ,· si deformem, non habebo communem.

Dilemma nihil aliud est, quam Inductio Nega-

tivam; in qua Syllogismi Major Conditionalis est

¹¹¹ This remark is taken from VVaffls, and is only applicable
to the Dilemma in his sense of the term. The negative
induction appears categorically in this form:

There are no instances of C being D, nor of Ε being F.
But these are all the possible instances of A being B.
There is no instance of A being B.

The Dilemma of Aldrich cannot, as it stands, be reduced to
this form. The categorica] conclusion, e. g. Nulla uxor est
ducenda, does not follow from the preniises of the Dilemma
of Bias; but requires the additional assumption, that neither
matrimonial nuisance is, under any circumstance, to be
endured. This brings it to Wallis's form, thus:

Si ducenda est umor, aut formosa ducenda est, aut deformis:
Atqui non est ducenda formosa, neque deformis:
Erqo, Umor ozon est ducenda. (Burgersdyck, Inst. Loy. ii. 13.)

The Complex Dilemma, as given above, may be reduced,
if required, to a series of hypothetical syllogisms, and so to
categorieals: thus:

Constructive. Destructive.
IfEisF,GisH; IfEisF‚GisH;
IfAisnotB‚EisF; IfCisD‚GisnotH;

ΗΑ is not B, G is H. If C is D, E is not F.
IfCisnotD,AisnotB; IfAisB‚CisD:
If C is not D, G is H. If A is B, Ε is not F.

The reduction os the simple Dilemma is obvious enough.
