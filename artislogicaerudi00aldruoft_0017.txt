INTRODUCTION.

PART 1. HISTORIGAL.

ALTHOUGH the writings of Aristotle are the source from history of
which the science of Logic is principally derived, it is {iozggsme
remarkable that there is no single name sanctioned by
the Stagirite himself, under which can be comprehended
either the whole collection of treatises known by the
name of the Organon, or the whole subject of which they
treat. Λογικῆ, as the name of an art or science, is not to
be found in his works, and thc cognate terms λογικὸς and
λογικῶς, are used in a very different sense from that
which has subsequently been given to themss. The
loyz'cal sylloyism of Aristotle is opposed sometimes to the
analytical, sometimes to the pkysical, sometimes to the
demonstrative syllogism3 and signifies a process of
reasoning from general principles of probability, as
distinguished from one of which the principles are
elicited by special contemplation of a given object or
notionb. It is therefore opposed, alike to the demon-
strative reasoning, in which necessary truths are resolved
into the axiomatic principles on which they depend,
and to that by which physical phenomena are referred
to general laws of nature.

The first use of the term Loyz‘c, as the name of a

science, is probably later than Aristotle, and to be re-
