A recent writer has exhibited thc Inductive Method of
Socrates as a specimen of that Inductio per enumera-
tionem simplicem which the Baconian philosophy has
supersededs. But it has been before observcd that the
Socratic rcasoning is not properly Induction, but Eoeample.
It is inconclusive, not because it is an Induction by
Simple Enumeraffion, but because it is no Induction at
all. The Simple Enumerafflon, if complete, will form the
basis of what, logically speaking, is a valid Inducti0n3
and it is precisely because the Socratic Method does
not pretend to completeneSS‚ that Logic does not recog-
nise the inference. Itis true that in Simple Enumeration
this completeness is often difficult, sometimes impossible
to attain. And it is the additional security on this point
that constitutes the chief merit of the Baconian process.
But this is a material, not a loyz'cal, merit. It affects our
yround of confidence in the truth of certain propositions‚
not the nature of the inference from those propositions
assumed to be true. Neither in Induction nor in Syl-
logism does the Organon of Bacon supersede that of ’
Aristotle. “ Each,'’ as Sir W. Hamilton observes,
“ proposes a different end3 both, in different ways, are
usefung' The ancient Philosopher considers “ the laws
under which the subject thinks ;'’ the modern, “those
under which tlte object is to be known.'' The Induction
of Bacon, as furnishing more accurate rules for physical
investigation, may supersede the Induction of Socrates3
sor the latter owes its validity solely to the matter. It
cannot affect the Induction of Aristode, of which the
validity depends solely on the form.

The perversions of the Aristotelian Induction by Aldrich
and Archbishop thately have already been noticed. On
this point it will be sufficient to observe, that any attempt
