Blemmi- is the Epitome Loyz'ca of Nicephorus Bleinmidas, written

«las. in the thirteenth century, which has been quoted as

containing the earliest instance of that system of logical
mnemonics which the schoohnen afterwards brought to
such perfectioni. The list of Greek Logicians closes

script of other Latin compendia similar in contente to the Summnloe, and
having the appearance of distinct translations from the same original.
To this must be added the testimony of the Augsburg MS. used by
Ehinger, (now at Munich‚) which is inscribed τοῦ σοφωτάτου Ψέλλου εἷς
τὴν Ἀριστοτέλους λογικὴν ἐπιστήμην σύνοψις.

On the other hand it should be obseroed,

1⁰. That there 13 111 the Bodleian Library (Cod. Mise. cclxxv. f. 282.b.)
a MS. inscribed ἐκ τῆς διαλεκτικῆς τοῦ Μα”ι”στωρος Πέτρου τοῦ Ἱσπανοῦ
ἑρμηνεία τοῦ Σχολαρῖου. Τ1113 MS. [ have examined in several places, and
find it to correspond exactly with the work published by Ehinger under

, 1116 name of Psellus. There are also extant four other MSS. having the
same title and the same beginning, (Διαλεκτική ἐστι τέχνη τεχνῶν καὶ
ἐπιστήμη ἐπιστημῶν,) viz. one at Florence, (Bandini, vol. iii. p. 19.) one
at Madrid, (Iriarte, vol. i. p. 276.) one at Vienna, (Lanibee. vol. viii. p.
818.) and one at Milan, (Allatius apud Fabricium, Bibl. erc. vol. xi. p.
392. Harles.) Of these the three last are expressly ascribed to Scho-
larius as the translator. A sixth MS. at Moseow with the same title
13 mentioned by Fabricius, (vol. xi. p. 337. Harles‚) but Ι have not been
able to ascertain any thing about its 6011161113.

20. It is evident that the Author of the Summulae was very ignorant of
Greek. His derivation os Dialvctim, ‘⁴ A dia. quod est duo, et loyes quod
est servm, vel lexis quod est ra!i0; qnasi duorum sermo vel ratio‚'’ could
hardly have been made by a translator from the Greek Synopsis‚ where
the derivation is given correetly⁴

30. The only 11111611101116 which occurs in the body os the Greek Synopsis
is one for the opposition of modals, expressed by the words, δουλούμεναι
ἷλιοίδες παρνασιόυ ἐκτρέχουσι. 'she use of the diphthong would hardly have
occurred to an original writer, though naturally suggested by the purpurea,
iliaco, amabimus, edentuli of the Latin logician.

On the whole, the woight os evidence seems· decidedly in favour of the
opinion which considers the Gretk Synopsis to be a translation of the
Sununulae os Hispanus, probably made by Georgius scholarius, afterwards
known as Gennadius.

For some of the materials of this note Ι ani indebtcd to a private
connnunication sroni 1116 late Sir W. I·Ia1nilton, whose published opinion
11113 been referred to already.

³ See St. Milan-0, Μιῑηιυὶνιι, vol. ii. p. 160. 11, may be questioned whether
uw Latin Logicians 1116 indcbted to the Greek in {his respect. See Sir
W. llzunillon's summimus, 1». 128, (571, and below, p. 8¹1.
