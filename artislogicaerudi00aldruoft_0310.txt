ΟΝ EXAMPLE AND ANALOGY.

EXAMPLE is defined by Aristotle, ‘⁶ proving the major
term of the middle by a term resembling the min01·⁸⁸.''
This definition is obscure, from being worded so as to
contrast with his definition of Induction, in which the
major term is proved of the middle by the minor. It
does not apply to the singular conclusion ultimately
established, but to the universal proposition which forms
the conclusion of the inductive portion of the Example.
Thus, if we expand Aristotle⁷s instance into its complete
form, eomposed of an imperfect induction and a syllo-
gism, it will run thus:

The war of the Thebans and Phoeians (D) was an
evil (A),
The war of the Thebans and Phocians was a war between
neighbours (B),
All wars between neighbours are evil.
A war between the Athenians and Thebans (C) is a war
between neighbours.
It is an evil.

In this reasoning there are four terms, A the major, B the
middle, G the minor, D the ὁμοῖον. The definition applies
to the third proposition, in which A is proved of B by
means of D. If the final conclusion were taken into
account, the Example might be more correetly defined
as a reasoning in which the major term is proved of the
minor by means of a middle, of which middle the major
has been proved by a term resembling the minor.
