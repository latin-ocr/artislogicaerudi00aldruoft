NOTE A.

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ PREDICABLES.

IT has been already observed that the ordinary
logical account of the Predicables, even in its least
objectionable form, as it occurs in the Isagoge of Por-
phyry, cannot be consistently maintained, except upon
Realist principles. By this is meant, that there are
portions of that account altogether untenable, except on
the supposition that Genera and Species are not mere
conceptions of the human mind, but have an independent
existence in Nature. XVhether they are to be regarded
as existing separately, as in the Platonic theory of ideas,
or in the individuals, according to the view sometimes
attributed to Aristotle, (for both these opinions had their
advocates among the Sclioollnen³,) is in this respect
immaterial 3 though it may be observed by the way, that
of the various modifications to Which Realism has at
different times been subjected, the Platonic hypothesis
is by far the most consistent and intelligible. The

b Both were early, almost simultaneous, developments of the scholastio
Realism, appear-ing as soon as the Nominalism of Roscelin compelled the
antagonist doctrines to assume a definite form. The Platonic theory was
advocated. by Bernard of Chartres; the other, ultimately the prevailing
doctrine, found its earliest scholastic supporter in William of Champeaux.
