APPENDIX. 189

the object defined must in every case be a Species. Summa
Genera and Individuals are in that case alone inde-
finable. And for this limitation‚ the authority of Aristotle
may be cited. On the other hand, Lockeb assures us
that this restriction is erroneous, and that Simple Ideas
alone are incapable of Definiti0n0. The dispute may be
reduced to a mere verbal question. For Aristotle does
not maintain that all Definitions must be by Genus and
Differentia, but only those of Substances. In the pas-
sages which seem to extend this rule, Definition is used
in the narrow sense which has been previously men-
tionedd. For it is obvious, to take the instances adduced
above, that ‘⁶ quenching'’ cannot be called the genus of

b Essay, b. iii. 4. 7. But Locke has in this matter been anticipated by
Descartes, Princip. i. 10. Sir W. Hamilton (Reid's Works, p. 220.) main-
tains that Aristotle has said the same thing. It is dangerous to dispute
any thing which a inan of Sir William’s learning professes to have dis-
covered in so wide a field as Aristode, especially as he gives no references;
but if the passage alluded to be Meta-ph. vi. 17. 7. one might be tempted to
hazard a different interpretation. Τὰ ἁπλᾶ seem rather to be the elements,
(ἁπλᾶ σώματα, Met. vii. 1. 2.) which have not, like compound substances,
received a definite form, and thus are not definable. Cf. Plato, Theaet.
p. 205. c. But the words are not sufficiently deeisive to furnish much
ground for any theory. A more remarkable passage occurs in Occam’s
Logic, Pt. i. ch. 23. “ Ex praedictis sequitur quod nulla intent-io quae est
praecise communis rebus simplicibus carentibus compositione ex materia et
forma habet differentias essentiales ; quia non habet partes, quamvis possit
habere multas differentias accidentales. Ex illo sequitur ulterius quod
nulla species quae est praecise simplicium est definibilis definitione proprie
dicta, sive sit in genere substantiae sive in quocunque alio praedicamento.’'
This, coupled with Occam’s Conceptualist theory of Universals, is not very
different from Locke's position concerning Simple Ideas.

⁰ By Simple Ideas, Locke meant all ideas derived immediately from
sensation or reflection. In the formation of these the mind is wholly
passive, whereas in the formation from them of Complex Ideas, it is active.
Among Simple Ideas derived from sensation, he enumerates solidity,
space, figure, rest, and motion; from refiection, perception and volition 3
from both, pleasure and pain.
