APPENDIX. 253

The question, why a rectilinear figure of three sides, be
it called triangle-or not, has its angles equa] to two
right angles, remains unanswered.

Secondly. If geometrica] reasoning is merely “the
logical filiation of consequences which follow from an
assumed hypothesis,” there is no reason why its con-
clusions should be more important than those of any
other analysis of imaginary notions, such as (to use
Mr. Mill's illustration) a deduction of the physiologica}
properties of an imaginary animal, or the political
history of an imaginary commonwealth. The whole
character and history of mathematical science militates
against the admission of this consequence.

Π. Mr. Mill, while agreeing with Stewart that mathe-
matica] necessity is merely hypothetical and conse-
quential‚ saw clearly that Stewart's doctrine concerning
Definitions was untenable. This led him to adopt the
second theory, according to which geometrica] inferences
depend on Postulates assuming the existence of the
objects defined. Thus a triangle has its angles equa]
to two right angles, because there may really exist a
rectilinear figure having three sides, and this existence
is implied, though not verbally expressed, in the defi-
nition.

This theory derives some apparent support from the
use of the principle of superposition. When, for instance,
the demonstration of the fourth proposition of Euclid
supposes the triangle A B C to be applied to the triangle
D E F, it clearly assumes the existence of both triangles,
not merely as general notions, which are identical in
thought, but as distinct individual magnitudes, occupy-
ing space, and capable of being transferred from one
position in space to another. One non-entity cannot be

cle tout autre sens, s'il en a, pour n'avoir plus que celui auquel on le}
destine uniquement.’¹
