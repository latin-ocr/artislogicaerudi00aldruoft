regarded as the precursors of the Aristotelian doctrine
of searching for definitions by the two opposite methods,
afterwards known as those of Division and Induction‘l.

In Plato we find also the analysis of the Proposition,
with the noun and the verb as its constituent elements3
the union of the two being necessary to every assertion.
Aao'evoaa and λόγος correspond to each other as the ὁὲσω
and ὁ ’ἔξω λόγος of Aristot]e; the former being interna]
discourse without speech, the latter external, by the
voice. Λόγος is divided into φάο-ις and ἀπόφασιςῑ. In this
passage, Plato has furnished the groundwork of the
grammatical researches of the De Interpretatione.

The three highest laws of thought, the Principles of
Identity‚ contradiction, and Excluded Middle, are also
indicated, though not explicitly enunciated, in PlatoS.
But neither he nor Ar1stotle has accurately distinguished
between their very different positions in Logic and in
Bletaphysics. Indeed, this distinction cannot be con-
sidered as having been made with exactness by any
philosopher before Kant.

Some few elements of the Logic of Aristotle thusAristotle.
appear in the philosophy of his predecessors3 though
the science was not accurately distinguished either from
Grammar or from Metaphysics. A distinct treatment of
logical questions was undeniably first undertaken by the
Stagirite3 though still, if we regard the Organon as a
single work, with a considerable admixture of extraneous

principles also appear in the Second Alcibiades, p. 1393 but this dialogue
is generally allowed to be spurious. Aristotle enunciates them more
