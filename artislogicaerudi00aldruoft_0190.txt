II. Quae dicitur Destructz'vass.
Si C. D. tum K. Δ.
Sed non K. Δ. ergo non C. D.

ξ. 2. QUAE de Conditionali dicta sunt, Disjunctivoe
satis cavent. Ejus enim in Syllogismo positae
sententia conditionaliter efferri semper potesth.

ὅ The destructive syllogism is naturally reduced to the
second figure in the categorical form, and cannot in most
cases be brought to the first without considerable awkward-
ness. This may be avoided by comet-cing] the hypothetical
before reduction. A hypothetical proposition is converted by
Contrapositiom thus, “ If A is B, O is D‚” to, “ If G is not D,
A is not B.'' The syllogism may then be treated as a con-
structive. Cf. Hamilton on Reid, p. 697. Whately's Logic,
b. ii. ch. 4. ξ. 3.

Hypothetical as well as Gategorical reasonings may be
combined in a Sorites. The Hypothetical Sorites consistas
of a series of propositions, in which the consequent of each
-is the antecedent of the next; the conclusion being composed
of the first antecedent and the last consequent. Thus:

Constructive Sorites. Destructive Sorites.
IfAisB,CisD. IfAisB‚CisD.

IfCisD,EisF. IfGisD‚EisF.
IfEisF,GisH. IfEisEGisfl.
IfA is B, G is H. IfGis not H,Ais not B.

¹¹ With regard to the import of the disjunctive proposition,
Logicians are at issue. The majority (Kant among the
number) regard it as stating all possible cases; so that one
only of its members can be true. And Aquinas maintains
that any disjunctive proposition in which this condition is not
observcd is false. On this supposition all the four inferences
given by Aldrich are valid. But it may bo questioned whether
tho incompatibility of the inembcrs appears in thc form of
