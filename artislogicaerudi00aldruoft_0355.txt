as they come within the province of Logic, are governed
by the same laws, we may naturally expect to find some
resemblance between the illegitimate forms of each.
The resemblance, as will be seen hereafter, is by no
means perfect3 but the same general principles of classi-
fication will be found applicable to the various processes
of Thought, whether we are examining their legitimate
or their illegitimate results.

The first and most obvious principle of division is
into Forma] and Material FallacieS, according as the
source of the deception lies in the act of thought itself,
οι· in the object upon which, or the circumstances
under which, it is exercised. Strictly speaking, Formal
Fallacies alone come under the cognisance of the Loyica
docens, or Logic properly so called3 as being apparent
but not real thoughts, or at least not the kind of thoughts
which they profess to be. Material Fallacies, where
the thought is legitimate, but the relation to things
inaccurate, belong properly to the province of the Loqz'ca
utens, and can only be adequately guarded against by
that branch of knowledge which takes cognisance of
the things. A minute division of Materia] Fallacies
may thus be carried on to an indefinite extent3 for any
object about which we think may be represented in
thought inaccurately or untruly. The Logician must
content himself with indicating the most general prin-
ciples of such a division3 and that not strictly as a
portion of the theory of his science, bufas a hint for
its application' to practice. To these two classes of
Fallacies, which are those which suggest themselves
a priori, as implied in the idea of any possible exercise
of thought, it becomes necessary in practice to add a
third class, comprising those which arise from the
ambiguities of language. Words, whether written, or
spoken, or exhibited in some other system of signs, are
