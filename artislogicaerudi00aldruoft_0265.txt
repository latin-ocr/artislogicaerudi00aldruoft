ΟΝ DEFINITION.

ΙΝ the notes to Aldrich’s account of Definition, I have
endeavoured to explain his language in conformity with
the views most commonly found in Logical Treatises.
But as these views differ in many respects from those of
Aristotle, on which they are supposed to be founded, and
as a correct account of the doctrines of that Philosopher
will materially assist in the solution of more than one
of those vexatce quaestiones which are most perplexing
to beginners in Logic, I shall attempt a somewhat fuller
exposition here.

ln the second Book of the Posterior Analyfflcs, Aristotle
mentions three different forms of Definition‚ in the
following words: ’Έο-τιν ἄρα ὁρισμὸς εἷς μὲν λόγος τοῦ τί ἐστιν
ἀναπόδεικτος, εἷς δὲ συλλογισμὸς τοῦ τί ἐστι, πτώσει διαφέρων τῆς
ἀποδείξεως, τρίτος δὲ τῆς τοῦ τί ἐστιν ἀποδείξεως συμπέρασμαῧ.
This passage is a concise summary of the whole Aristo-
telian theory of Definition. Adopting it as our text, we
proceed to comment as follows.

A necessary preliminary to the determining the Real
Definition of any object, (τί svm) is to ascertain that such
object exists (ἔτι ἔστι). Otherwise our Definition will
be merely a nomina] oneb. But we have two classes of
definable objects, of which the existence is determined
in two different ways, producing a corresponding variety
in the form of the Definition.

b Anal. Post. ii. 8. 3. Ἀδύνατον εἰδέναι τί ἐστιν, ἆγνοοῦβτας εἷ ἔστιν.
Ibid. ii¹ 7. 9.. Ἀνάγκη γὰρ τὸν εἰδότα τὸ τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος ἢ ἄλλο ὁτιοῦν,
εἰδέναι καὶ ὅτι ἔστιν· τὸ γὰρ μὴ ὒν οὐδεὶς οἶδεν ὅ τι ἐστίν, ἀλλὰ τί μὲν
σημαίνει ὁ λόγος ἢ τὸ ὄνομα, ὅταν εἴπω τραγέλαφος, τί δ’ ἔστι τραγέλαφος
ἀδύνατον εἰδέναι.
