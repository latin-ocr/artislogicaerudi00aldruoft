18⁶2 APPENDIX.

I. Attributes, under which term are included all things
belonging to any other Category than that of Substance.
These exist only in Substances as their subjects, and
their existence is properly determined by DemonstrationC.
When ascertained in any other way, we are said to know
it only accidentallyd. In the Demonstrative Syllogism,
the minor term is the Subject, the major the Attribute;
the Oanse, by virtue of which the Subject is thus affected,
being the middle term. When by such a Syllogism we
have proved that all A is B, we know that the attribute
B exists in the subject A.

Π. Substanoes, which exist not in a Subject‚ but per
88⁰. Of such the existence cannot be proved, but must
be assumed, before any of their Attribntes can be demon-
strated. This assumption under the name of Hypofflesis,
forms one of the Aristotelian ἀρχαί, or Principles of
Science, which must precede all Demonstrations.

⁶ Hence the Scholastic maxim, Accidentis esse est inesse. Cf. Aquinas,
Opusc. xlviii. de Syll. Demonst. c. ll. I have preferred the term Attri-
bute to Accident, inasmuch as the latter is frequently appropriated in a
special sense- to such Attributes as exist only contingently‚ ancl are therefore
indemonstrable.

ἐπιστήμην.
