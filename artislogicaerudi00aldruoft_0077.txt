In the first place: the purpose of the Aristotelian
Logic is to‘investigate the laws under which the subject
thinks3 the purpose of the Baconian Logic is to iuves-2
tigate the laws under which the phenomena of the object
take place ²¹. They are thus respectively occupied with
the two opposite poles of human knowledge, the 390 and
the non eqo. The questions of the former are to be an-
swered by an examination of the internal consciousness3
the questions of the latter by an examinatior] of externa]
nature. The two systems are thus diametrically opposed
to each other in their objects. In the second place: the
Aristotelian laws are laws of thought as it ouylzt to be.
The Baconian laws are laws of nature as z't is. The
former are principles resting upon their own evidence3
certain &priori as laws, whether actually complied with or
not3 approving themselves to consciousness the instant
they are enunciated3 and irreversible in thought, because
thought itsels is under their control. The latter are laws
resting upon the evidence of the facts to which they relate3
valid only in so far as they are actually complied with3
and ceasing to be laws at all, the instant that an ex-
ception to them is discovered. And, however universally
true in nature, they are always reversible in thought3
for prior to their discovery we had no reason to think of
then] at all, and afterwards we have only to discard an
adventitious knowledge. The two systems are thus dis-
tinct in their evidence ,· the opposite of the one being the
mentally inconceivable, that of the other the physically
'impossible In the third place: in the applications of
the Aristotelian Logic we proc-ced from the law to the
facts, constructing types of reasoning according to given
principles, and accepting or rejecting all actual cases,
according as they do or do not exemplify the law. In
the applications of thc Baconian Logic we proceed from
