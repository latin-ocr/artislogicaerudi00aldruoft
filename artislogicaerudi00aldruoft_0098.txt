² The copula has an apparent resemblance to the gram-
matical verb, as being the only part of a logical proposition
capable of personal inflection. But inflection is one of the
accidents, not one of the essentials of a verb, and belongs
to particular, not to universal grammar. The essence of a
grammatical verb lies in its signification, being a coinbination
of an attribute and an assertion. Of. Stoddart, Universal
Grammar, p. 121. Latham‚ Enylish Lanyuaqe, p. 461. The
copula must of course not be confounded with the verb
est, which predicates existence, as “ Homo est.'' The whole
question is ably treated by Pacius on de Im. ch. 3. Cf. Riese,
Philosophia des Aristoteles, vol. i. p. 95.

into copula and predicate.
