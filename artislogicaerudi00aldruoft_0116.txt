‘¹ This delineation of the Arbor Porphyriana is first given
by Aquinas, Opusc. xlviii. Tract. ii. cap. 3. In all the earlier
specimens, Animal Rationale is placed between Animal and
Homo as the prooeimum qartus, and divided into mortale and
inmortale, in accordance with Porphyry's definition of Man.
