every disjunctive proposition. We may happen to know that
two alternatives cannot be true together, so that the affirmation
of the second necessitates the denial of the first, and the
affirmation of the first the denial of the second; but this, as
Boethius observes, is a material, not a formal consequence,
whether it be stated in the hypothetical or disjunctive form.
It must be allowed that the examples sometimes adduced on
this side of the question have not been very happily chosen.
It sounds oddly enough to state a known truth as a possible
falsehood, as in the instance, “ Bellieni, Trojanum cecinit vel
Homerus vel Viryiliusst' But other and more natural specimens
have been given; e. g. “ Aut olim Troja fuit, aut historia de
bello Trojano est mera fabula.’' The case is still clearer when
both members of the disjunctive are negative, as in the
example given by Boethius, “ si enim quis dicat, aut non
est album aut non est nigrum, sive album non esse as-
sumpserit, non necesse erit esse vel non esse nigrum: sive
nigrum non esse assumpserit, ut sit vel non sit album, nullam
faciet necessitatem.” On this supposition only two of the

above syllogisms are valid, which may be reduced to hypothe-
ticals as follows:

Constructive. Destructive.
IfAisnotB‚CisD. IfAis notB,Cis D.
But A is not Β. But C is not D.

C is D. A is B.
