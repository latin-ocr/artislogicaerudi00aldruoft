sible truth that some B is not A. Hence the same
belief is regarded as possible and impossible at the
same time, and thus the conclusion, though not directly
at variance with what the premise asseris, cannot be
drawn consistently with what it permit& Hence these
and cognate forms of reasoning are classed in the Table
as violating the Law of Contradiction indirectly ,· and the
conclusion is noted as formally invalid‚ though mate-
rially it may be either true or false. Thus the whole
process may be valid as a series of judgments, but not
as a reasoning3 and the thought, therefore, is not the kind
of thought which it professes to be. On the other hand,
if a conclusion is drawn opposed to that which the laws
of thought require, the conclusion is neither materially
nor formally possible3 and the supposed reasoning is in
reality no thought at all. Thus we may, verbally at least,
argue, “ All A is Β, Ο is A, therefore C is not B ;'’ which
requires us to conceive C as being at the same time B
and not B. Here the Law of Contradiction is violated
directly. The relation of logical fallacies to this law
will be seen much more clearly, if, in accordance with
the system of Sir William Hamilton, we assign to the
predicate as well as to the subject of every proposition
an expressed mark of quantity.

To attempt a complete enumeration of Materia]
Fallacies would be an endless as well as a protitless
task. Under the head of Reasoning, it has been thought
sufficient to arrange in their proper places the members
of the usually received list. The arrangement has been
made according to the instances given by Aldrich and
other modern Logicians, as being most familiar to the
majority of readers. These, however, occasionally differ
in points of detail from those which are found in the
original text of Aristotle. The discrepancy is of little
