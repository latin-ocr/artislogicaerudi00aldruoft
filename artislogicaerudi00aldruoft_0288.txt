so it need not presuppose a complete enumeration of

them ¹¹.

‘⁶ For, when one's proofs are aptly chosen,
Four are as valid as four dozen.”

To determine under what conditions such a conviction
can be obtained, is a question requiring an analysis of
the whole process of Induction. Such an analysis, in
many respects most ably performedf, will be found in
the third book of Mr. Mill's Logi03 but few I think can
compare that part of the work with his earlier defence of
the Syllogism, without admitting that the two presuppose
different and inconsistent theories of the import of

ἢ “ Hinc jam patet, inductionem per se nihil producere, ne certitudinem
quidem moralem, sine adminiculo propositionum non ab inductione, sed
ratione universali pendentium3 nam si essent et adminicula ab inductione,
indigerent novis adminiculis nec haberetur certitudo moralis in infinitum.
Sed certitudo perfecta ab inductione sperari plane non potest, additis
quibuscunque adminiculis, et propositionem hanc: totum majus esse sua
parte, sola inductione nunquam perfecte sciemus. Mox enim prodibit, qui
negabit ob peculiarem quandam rationem in aliis nondum tentatis veram
esse.” Leibnitz, de Stylo Nizolii.

Mr. Mill's adminicula to Induction are certain canons stating the prin-
ciples of the Method of Agreement, of Difference, διο. which, together with
the whole law of universal causation, he makes dependent upon a wealcer
evidence than philosophical induction3 the inductio per enumerationem
simplicem. At the same time he enters his protest against “ adducing, as
evidence of the truth os a fact in external nature, any necessity which the
human mind may be conceived to be under of believing it.'' His words,
strictly taken, would on his own shewing destroy the evidence of our
senses; for, according to the theory of perception adopted by himself and
his favourite authority, Brown, sensations can only be regarded as states
of mind, and the only reason we have for referring our interna] conscious-
ness to an exter-nal cause is, that by the constitution of our minds we are
necessitated to do so. The admonition of Hooker is not quite obsolete
even amid the lights of modern philosophy. “ The main principles of
Reason are in themselves apparent. For to make nothing evident os itself
to man's understanding were to take away all possibility of kuowing any
thing. And hei-ein that os Theophrastus is true, ‘ They that seek a reason
of all things do utterly overthrow Reason: '' Eccl. Pol. i. 8. 5.
