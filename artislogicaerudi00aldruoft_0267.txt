APPENDix. 183

In some passages, speaking in a stricter seiise‚}Aristotle
declares Substances alone to be capable of Definitiong3
but in the wider sense of the term which prevails through-
out the Posterior Analytich it is applicable both to
Substances and to Attributes. In both cases the inquiry
into the Definition of a thing is identical with that into
its cause3 with this distinction, that in the case of
Attributes‚ the Cause is to be sought‚ not- in the Attribute>
but in its Subject3 whereas in the case of Substances
which exist per se, the Gause is to be sought in themselves
onlyh.

Attributes are defined by the same cause which served
as a middle term to prove their existence. This is the
mode of Definition described 33 συλλογισμὸς τοῦ τί ἐστι,
πτώσει διαφέρων τῆς ἀποδείξεως. Α3 311 example, he gives
the definition of an eclipse. The moon is proved to be
eclipsed‚ because the sun’s light is intercepted by the
earth. The same cause furnishes us at once with a
middle term for demonstratiom and with a definition of
the attributei. Why is the moon eclipsed? Because

From this it wil] be seen that Mr. Mill has unjustly aecused Aristotle of
maintaining that the seience of Geometry is deduced from Dcfinitions.
(Mill’s Logic, vol. i. p. 197.) Hence may also be explained the contradiction
which Stewart professes to find in Aristotle’s doctrines. (Elements‚ Pt. ii.
ch. 3. sect. i.) The principles from which Aristotle demonstrates, are Axioms,
of which he gives as 3 specimen, ‘⁶ If equals be taken from equals, the
remainders are 6111131.Η The necessity of assuming the existence of the
subject is maintained by Aristotle as clearly as by Mr. Mill. Cf. also

¹ The reduction of this Demonstration to syllogistic form has been
variously attempted. The following is given by Aquinas, Opusc. 38.
“ Omne corpus naturale, illuminatum 3 3016, privatum luce a terrae objectu
deficit3 111113 est hujusmodi, ergoluna deficit.'' A more general, and. so far
preferable, major premise, is given by Crakanthorpe, Log. lib. iv. cap. 4.
