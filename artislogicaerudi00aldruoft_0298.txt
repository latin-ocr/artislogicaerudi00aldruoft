the logical accuracy of his reasoning. In Dialectic‚ two
chanipions are opposed to each other: they may, before
engaging, dictate the conditions of the combat.

As regards the account of the Enthymeme in the
Prior Analytics, I arn not aware that any further expla-
nation is nee—dedi. But in the corresponding chapters of
the Rhetoric one or two difficulties remain, an elucida-
tion of which, though not strictly within my present
province, may perhaps be serviceable to the readers of
the latter Treatise.

In Rhet. i. 2, 18. we are told, that when the Enthymeme
is in the third figure, the σημεῖον is to its conclusion as a
particular to an universal. In the second figure, on the
other hand, as an universal to a particular. The relation
in the first figure is not mentioned, but the context seems
rather to connect it with the former than with the latter.

This passage may be interpreted in two ways. Either
we may compare the conclusion of the Enthymeme
with the σημεῖον itself, or with the major premise os
that Syllogisrn whose minor is the σημεῖον. In the former
interpretation the word σημεῖον is used properly for the
propositiom· in the latter widely, for the reasoning of
which such proposition forms a portion.

If the first interpretation be adopted, (which seems
preferable,) we must compare the two propositions
relatively to that term in which they are unlike3 i. e. if
they have the sanie subject, we must compare their

‘ Except perhaps that Aristotle, in Anal. Pr. ii. 27„ admits a σημεῖον in
the sam-ond figure, which in the former chapter he condemned. The eon-
.l‹·11111ati‹›n seems to be made on logical grounds. The loyical value of two
affirmative premis-ss in the second figure is absolute zero; whereas the
σημεῖον in the third figure, though faulty as employed to prox-e an universal
conclusism, is valid sor particulam. For rhvtorimtl purpose& however, the
second figure is also adinissihhu nn aecrnnuhrtion os Enthymemos, all
