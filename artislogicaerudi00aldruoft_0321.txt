APPEme. 237

To state that this hypothesis is in a certain instance
true, adds nothing to the Zoqical part of the reasoning,
but only verifies the empirica] preliminaries which the
Logician in every case assumes as given. To exhibit
a formal consequence hypothetically, is only a needless
reassertion of the existence of data which the act
of thought presupposes. To exhibit a material con-
sequence hypothetically, is not to make it formal, but
only to state that, in a certain given instance, a con-
sequence not cognisable by Logic takes place. The
sequence of “ C is D‚” from “ A is B‚” is not one whit
more logical than it was before3 it is only stated to take
place materially in the present case.

The omission of hypothetica] syllogisms has fre—
quently been blamed as a defect in Aristotle’s Organon3
and his French translator takes some fruitless pains
to strain his text, in order to make out that he does
in fact treat of them1. If there is any truth in the
preceding observationS, it will follow, that Aristotle
understood the limits of Logic better than his critics3
and that his translator had better have allowed the
omission as a merit than have attempted to deny it as
a fault. then the hypothetical proposition states a
formal consequence, the reasoning grounded upon it
may always be reduced to categorical. When it states
a material consequence, it states what the Logician, as
such, cannot take into account. Aristotle is therefore
quite right in saying, that in this case the conclusion
is not proved, but concededffl. Syllogism may be em-
ployed as a logical proof of the antecedent: the con-
sequent is admitted to follow on grounds which the
Logician, as such, does not investigate, but which may
