defenders. For the Petitz'o Principii being 111 that case
a particular misapplication of the syllogistic method‚ and
postulating the latter as a condition of its practicability,
they have inverted the relation of prior and posterior,
and assumed Petitio Principii to be necessary to the
existence of Syllogism.

But if, on the other hand, there are no such cases,
and the Syllogism is in consequence henceforth to be
banished from Philosophy, what do we gain in ex—
change? We reduce the Laws of Thought from neces-
sary to contingent. W'e degrade certainty into proba-
bility, and can claim for that only a subjective validity.
But until this latter hypothesis is proved, the Syllogism,
whatever may be its errors or deficiencies, cannot be
comprehended under any one of the fallacies admitted
to be such by the Loyicz'an. And this is sufficient as a
defence of his own consistency. His inethod may be an
incorrect analysis of the laws of the reasoning process, it
may be that there are no such laws at all. But of either
of these positions the omas probandi lies with the assail-
ants, not with the defenders of the Syllogism ⁰. Itis quite
enough for the Logician, if he exhibits all that is generally
considered valid reasoning in a syllogistic form. If any
maintain that a simpler or better type is attainable, he
waits With patience till they produce it. If all reasoning
is fallacious, he may be contented to behold his theories
fall in the general overthrow of all human knowledge.
But, pending the decision of this question, he may leave

0 To the charge of Petilio Principii which Campbell makes against the
Syssogism, Archbishop Whately replies, that it lies aqainst all aryztments
wltalever; the Syllogism not being a distinct kind of argument, but any
argument whatever, stated regularly and at full length. And this reply is
substantially valid, even if we reject the Archbishop’s mode of exhibiting
Induction as a Syllogism in Barbara. For the objection of Campbell, if
valid at all, lies against all formal reasoning; and logical Induction, in its
true analysis‚ is equally formal with the Syllogism.
