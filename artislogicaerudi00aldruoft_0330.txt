It is not denied that there are passages in Aristotle
which may seem to countenance this interpretation, but
there are others so palpably inconsistent with it that
we are compelled to seek for a new explanation of the
former.

In the first place, Aristotle distinctly condemns the
assumption of Definitions as a Petitio Principiz'i, a charge
to which the above.example is obviously liable3 the real
question to be proved being, that the three-sided figure
has its angles equal to two right angles, whether it is
called a triangle or not. In the second place, he says
that Demonstration proceeds from ammons, and cites
as a specimen of the latter, “ If equals be taken from
equals, the remainders are equa11‘.” These axioms,
he says, are common to many classes of objects3 but,
in any single Science, need only be assumed to an
extent commensurate with the object-matter of that
Science. The above axiom, sor example, is true of
other things besides Geometrical Magnitudes, but it is
sufficient for the Geometer to assume it as true of these
only.

Now if an axiom of this kind be the major premise in
a Demonstration, it is manifest that its predicate will
also be the predicate of the Conclusion3 and that the
logical form of that Conclusion will be, not “All
triangles are figures having their angles cqual to two
right angles,” but, ‘⁶ Triangles and figures having their
angles equal to two right angles are equal to each
otlicr.''

The immediate Syllogism from which this pro-
position is proved by Euclid‚ may be logically stated
as follows:
