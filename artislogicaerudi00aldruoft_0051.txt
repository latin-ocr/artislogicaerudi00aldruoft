INTRODUCTION. xlvii

tracting of our thoughts and of their signs. A pro-
position is but the addition of two nameS, and a
syllogism the adding together of three. In a proposition,
two names are so coupled together, that he that speaks
conceives both to be names of the same thing; from
whence it follows that truth and falsehood consist only
in speech, and that the first truths were arbitrarily
made by those who first imposed names on things. A
full criticism of this doctrine would exceed my present
limits. I can only observe that the main error of Hobbes
does not lie, as is sometimes said, in his theory of notions,
but in that of juclyments. He has overlooked the fact,
that apprehension is primarily the analysis of judg-
ment, notjudgment the synthesis of apprehensions.

The Baconian influence is also manifest in Gassendi,Gassendi.
the friend of Hobbes and the antagonist of Descartes.
Like Hobbes, he describes reasoning as a computation‚
and he anticipates Condillac in tracing all knowledge
to sensation. He adopts the fourfold division of Logic,
into Apprehension‚ Judgment, Reasoning, and Method,
which had virtually been invented by Ramus and
accepted by the Semi-Ramists, and which was shortly
afterwards adopted by the Port Royal Logic. He
admits two figures only of Syllogism, an affirmative
and a negative, (answering to the affirmative and nega-
tive moods of the first figure in Aristotle3) and it is worthy
of remark, that in the order of the premises, he returns
to the arrangement of the Greek Logicians‚ (the reverse
of that of the Latius,) and places the minor before the
major. His theory of reduction, by which he brings
every syllogism ostensively to his two figures, contains
some curious blundel-s.
