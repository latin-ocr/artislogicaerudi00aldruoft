thought cannot be actually separated from each other, being
merely the same act of thought viewed froin opposite sides.
Of objects out of the act of thought, the thinker knows
nothing. But in comparing two minds together, one of
whom is supposed to have a firm conviction of a true pro-
position on sufficient grounds, the other an equally firm con-
viction of a false proposition, the difference between them
will lie, not in the state of conviction which is common to
both, but in the object on which it is exercised; and the
change from error to knowledge will be effected by the
substitution of one object for another. On the other hand,
if a truth known scientifically by one man is assented to with
hesitation by another. the difference lies in their respective
states of mind 'm relation to a common object, and the change
from opinion to knowledge will consist in a different mode of
contemplating the same truth. Hence, in strict accuracy, we
should say, that the characteristic of error is the attribution
of certainty to a wrong objeet; that of opinion, the absence
of certainty in the subject. The-criterion of knowledge from
error is strictly the character of the object as it appears to a
rightly informed mind; and hence, among the later Logicians‚
we find respectu objecti used as equivalent to per se; and opposed
to respectu subjecti, as it appears to this particular thinker.
This forms the connecting link between the scholastie use
of objective to denote what exists only in thought, and the
modern use, to denote the absolute affections of things
without the mind.
