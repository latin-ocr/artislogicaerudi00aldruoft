of part and whole as simpler or more complex notions.
In this point of view, Division and Definition are respec-
tively the Synthesis and Analysis of notions as empressed
in simple terms. In the former, we combine Genus and
Differentia into Species3 in the latter, we resolve Species
into Genus and Differentia. A similar relation exists
between the processes of uniting Accidents to a Species,
in distinguishing its several individuals, and abstracting
the Specific notion from the Accidents, in the formation
of Universals. Syllogism and Induction in like manner
are respectively the Synthesis and Analysis of the same
notions when forminq the subjects of a judyment. For
on examination of the first figure, which is the natural
form of Syllogism‚ it will be seen, that it proceeds, by
division of the middle term, to predicate of the several
Species what was previously predicated of the Genus.
Inducffion, on the other hand, in its natural form, pro-
ceeds by a process of abstractim, from the individuals
constituting a Species to their common Species so con-
stituted.

As regards the etymology of the name3 both the
Greek ἐπαγωγή, and its Latin equivalent Inductio, seem
to have been originally applied with reference to the
Socratic accumulation of instances to serve as an ante-
cedent for establishing the required conclusion. The
Platonic use of ἐπάγειν will support this viewk. Such is
also clearly the interpretation of Cicero. “ Hoc in genere
praecipiendum nobis videtur, primum, ut illud quod
inducemus per similitudinem, ejusmodi sit, ut sit necesse
concedi3 nam ex quo postulabimus nobis illud quod
dubium sit concedi, dubium esse idipsum non oportebit.

Where Heindorf renders, ‘⁴ Consertius quam priora afferre, ita ut alterum
alteri addas, in singulis nihil immorans.” The substantive ἐπαγωγὴ has a
very different sense in Plat0; e.g. Rep. ii. p. 364. 6. Leg. xi. 933. d. Cf.
