APPENDIX. 249

and subject in each proposition, as stated, are not con-
vertible3 and the middle term is not a definition of the
minor. But of these requisitions, the first seems to be
founded on an erroneous interpretation of Aristode,
according to which that Philosopher is supposed to
speak of the Propositions as they appear when strictly
enunciated in logical form3 not (as seems more probable)
of the same Propositions as ordinarily stated by the
Geometer0. With regard to the second condition, the
text of Aristotle does not warrant its imposition. He
says indeed, that the middle term in demonstration must
be a definition of the majorP,· and the precept is intel-
ligible enough, if we rightly understand his theory of the
Definition of Attributes. As regards the minor term, it
would be difficult to produce a single passage where this
condition is clearly laid down as a law of Demonstration3
and there is more than one with which it would be no
easy task to reconcile it.

lf it be thought somewhat over-bold to repudiate
positions which so many eminent Logicians have
regarded as legitimate deductions from the text of
Aristotle3 it must be remembered that we have other
data for interpretation besides the mere weight of autho-
rity. Aristotle's theory of demonstration is principally
framed with reference to Geometry: the Scholastic
exampleS, on the other hand, are Physical. The medi-
aeval state of Physical science was perhaps such as to
justify, or at least to account for, the Logical and Meta-
physica] fictions connected with it, and to give a seeming
validity to the most potent demonstration of Risibility as
an emanation from Rationality; though that emanation
