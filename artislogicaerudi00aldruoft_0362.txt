conceived at all‚) or, on the other hand, to arres‘t the
process of subdivision at any limited number of at—
tributes, as the greatest number that can possibly be
united in one concept‘.

Thus the notion of a logical highest genus, that is,
of a concept so simple as to be incapable of further
analysis, is essentially obscure3 for, in actual thought,
we find that, so long as there is limitation and difference‚
there is also community, and, therefore, a possibility
of further analysis‘. Again, the notion of a logical lowest

ὃ The Highest Genus and Lowest Species of Logic must not be con-
founded with the same terms as applicable to this or that branch of
natural science. The Highest Genus in any special science is the general
class, comprehending all the objects whose properties that science in-
vestigatcs: the different Lowest Species are the classes at which that
special investigation terminates. In Geometry, for example, under the
summum yemes osmagnitudes in space, we find three coordinate itgfimoe species
of triangles‚ the equilateral, the isosceles, and the scalene. The Geo—
metrical properties of the figmes are not affected by further subdivision.
But the Logician, as such, knows nothing of Geometrical limitations. To
him the highest genus and lowest species are limits of the possibility of
thought; the former denoting a nction so simple as to admit of no further
subtraction, the latter, a notion so complex as to admit of no further
addition. In thought, the notion of an equilateral triangle whose sides
are three feet long is a subordinate species to that of an equilateral triangle
in general.

f It is not easy to draw the line between the materially and the formally
inconceivable. Being in general (Eas), and such like abstractions, may
be regarded as formally inconceivable, as having no contents. But these
abstractions are not necessarily identical with the notion os a highest
genus 3——indeed‚ the majority of Logic-ians have placed the summa yenera
in the Categories, of which Ens and the other transcendents were regarded
as predicable equivocally, or analoqously, but not umvocally. But the
Catcgories, again, are practically inconceivable per se ; for a substance is
only known by its attributes, and au attribute as existing in a substance.
But it is at least supposable that, under other conditions os cxperience,
we might arrive at notions sufiicicntly dcfinite to bc conceivable, yet so
diverse as not to admit of classification under a higher genus; and this is
virtuallyadniitted by Kant, who, notwithstanding, regards thc laws of
homogencity, specffication, and continuity as logical principles of the
reason. Ι prefer to consider them as empiricnl, though perhaps indicating
psyohologienl conditions of experience. Thus viewed, they are not, properly
