the peculial· character of certain matters about which we
may think, and not a law of the form of thought in general.

It is obvious that the relation of premises and con-
clusion in a syllogism may, like any other relation of
condition and conditioned, be expressed in the form of
a hypothetica] proposition: “If all A is Β, and all C is
A, then all O is B:'' and the actual assertion of the
truth of these premises will furnish at once a so-called
hypothetica] syllogism: “ But 311 A is B, and all O is A,
therefore all C is B.'’ This was observed by Fries, who
hence rightly maintains that analytical hypothetica]
judgments are formal syllogisms¹‘⁴⁷ It is strange that,
after this, he should not have gone a step further, and
discovered that synthetical hypothetica] judgments are
assertions of material consequence& The judgment,
“If A is B, O is D,'’ asserts the existence of a conse-
quence necessitated by laws other than those of thought,
and consequently out of the province of Logic. The
addition of a minor premise and conclusion in the so-
called hypothetica] syllogism, is merely the assertion
that this general material consequence is verified in 3
particular case.

The distinction so much insisted on by the KantianS,
of the problematical character of the two nlembers of a
hypothetica] judgment, is, like the whole Kantian doc-
trine of modality, of no consequence in formal Logic.
All formal thinking is, as regards the material character
of its objects, problematical only. Forma] Conception
pronounces that certain objects of thought may possibly
exist, leaving their actual existence to be determined by
experience. Forma] Judgment decides on the possible
coexistence of certain concepts3 and Forma] Reasoning,
on the truth of a conclusion, subject to the hypothesis os
the truth of its premises.
