are made to depend on a supposed inflatior] of the
sphere. Here is another implied postulate or axiom.
“ A hard body may be increased or diminished in size
to any extent without losing its hardness.'' Empirically,
this is untrue. A body which resists all change of form
cannot in practice be expanded or contracted ad libitam.
To assume it as imaginably true is to assume an axiom‚
not a definition.

Again: the author attempts to prove the majority of
the axioms of Euclid by superposition3 laying down
beforehand these two definitions3 “ Things which occupy
the same place, are said to coincide ;'’ and ‘⁶ Magnitudes
which, if their boundaries were applied to one another,
would coincide, or might be made capable of doing so
by a different arrangement of parm, are called equaZ.”
In the latter definition again there is an assumed postu-
late : ‘⁴ The parts of a body may be arranged in any way,
without affecting the magnitude of the body.'’ Otherwise
the two meanings of the term equal are a mere equi-
vocati0n3 and the demonstration of the equality of any
two given bodies is a mere play upon words. A is equal
to B because it actually coincides with it. G is equa] to
B because it may be made to coincide with it. But how
do Ι know that it is the same C before and after the,
change in the arrangement of its parts? If I may assert
that the two bodies are now equal, because a different
arrangement of parts may make them so, why may I not
assert that they are now equal, because by taking away a
part of one of them they may become so?

But even after this assumption is made, it may be
questioned whether the principle of superposition can
be legitimately applied to magnitudes considered as
exhibited on a hard body. Magnitudes in space can be
constructed apriori in a pure intuition, and in any one
part of space, as readily as in anv other. Hence they
