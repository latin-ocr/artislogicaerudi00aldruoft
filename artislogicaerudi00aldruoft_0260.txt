ration of the several genera under which Aristotle's four
heads of predicables fall. 3. As an enumeration of the
different modes in which Being may be signified. An
examination of the principle of classification is neces-
sary, in order that we may determine how far the charges
of deficiency and redundancy, so frequently‘brought
against Aristotle’s list, can be fair1y maintained.

The most celebrated of these accusations is that of
Kant¹¹. Assuming that Aristotle's design was identical
with his own, viz. to enumerate the pure or ὰ priori
conceptions of the understanding, he assei-ts that the
classification was made upon no principle3 that it was
found by the author to be defective, and the post-
predicaments added in consequence3 that the list thus
enlarged is still defective; that it contains forms of the
sensibility as well as of the understanding3 (quando, ubi,
situs, prius, simul‚·) that empirical notions are intruded
among the pure (motus), and deduced concepts classed as
original (actz‘0‚passio); and that some original elements
are altogether omittedb„

A somewhat similar criticism is given in Mr. Mill's
Logic. The Categories he supposes to be “ an enume-
ration of all things, capable of being named3 an enume-
ration by the summa ymera, i. e. the most extensive
classes into which things could be distributed3 which
therefore were so many highest Predioates, one or other
of which was supposed capable of being affirmed with
truth of every nameable thing whatsoever.'’ Thus viewed‚
he pronounces the list to be both redundant and de-
fective. Action, passion, and local situation, ought to
be included under relation3 together with position in
time (quando), and in space (ubi); while the distinction
