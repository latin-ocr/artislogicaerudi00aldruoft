its teaching by no other examples than algebraical
symbols. A treatise on Logic is not designed prirnarily
to give men facility in the practice of reasoning, any
more than a treatise on Optics is intended to improve
their sight3 and it would be as correct for a writer on
the mathematica] principles of Optics to entitle his work,
“ Optics, or the art of irnproving defective vision,'’ as it
is for a writer on the principles of Logic to adopt for
his title, “Logic, or the art of reasoning.'' Yet we do
not therefore deny that a knowledge of Optics is useful
in making spectacles, nor that a knowledge of Logic is
valuable in the practice of reasoning.

Art, in the strict sense of the term, is acquired by
practice, Science by stuclym. A man who has learnt to
reason accurately by practice in special cases, without
a knowledge of the laws of the syllogism, has the art of
reasoning, but not the science. He who knows the
theory, but does not practise it, has the science of
reasoning, but not the art. The Logic to be found in
treatises ou the subject, i. e. the Loyiea docem, is thus
clearly a science and not an artg for it is gained by
study and not by exercise. But there is a further dis-
tinction between speculative and practical science,
according as the knowledge which it conveys is con-
sidered as an end ln itself, or only as a means to be
applied to some further purpose ¹¹. And here again,

¹¹¹ See Wolf, Philosophia Rationalis, Proley. ξ. 10. “ Omnis Logica utens
est habitus, qui proprio exercitio comparatur, minime autem discendo
acquiritm, adeoque et ipsa doceri nequit. Quamobrem, cum Logica
omnis sit vel docens vel utens, neque enim praeter regularum notitiam
atque habitum eas ad praxin transferendi tertium concipi potest3 sola
Logica artificialis docens ea est quae doceri adeoque in numerum disci-
plinarum philosophicarum referri potest. Atque ideo quoque Logicam
definivimus per scientiam, minime autem per artem vel habitum in genere,
quod genus convenit Logicae utenti.’'
