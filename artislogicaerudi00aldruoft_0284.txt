and B is greater than C, therefore a fortiori A is greater
than O.” The logical form is,

Whatever is greater than a greater than C is greater than 03
A is greater than a greater than G,
Therefore A is greater than G.

Or if it be required that the a fortiori nature of the
reasoning appear in the conclusion, we must state the
major, “ Whatever is greater than a greater than C is
greater than C by a yreater dfference.'’

Of the same kind is the reasoning “A is equal to Β,
therefore twice A is equal to twice B.'’ The logical
form is,

The cloubles of equal things are equal;

Twice A and twice B are doubles of equal things,
Therefore they are equal.

The major premise might be stated more generally,
‘⁶ Equimultiples of equal things are equal.’'
