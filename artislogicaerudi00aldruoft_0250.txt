unalterable. The higher enter into the composition of
the lower, the lowest not contributing to form any other
Universal‚ but susceptible of Accidents, from which union
are formed various Individuals. Man, for example, is
a lowest species: to this are added certain accidental
modifications which form SocrateS, and at the same
time others which form Plato, These modifications
excepted, there is nothing in Socrates which is not
at the same time in Plato, nor in Plato, which is not
at the same time in Socratesi. Moreover, from these
Universa] Substances, or rather from the distinctive por-
tion of each, certain qualities stow, or are produced as
effect from cause. Others, not connected by causafion,
are found in the individuals of this or that Species, some
universally in all, others partially, in some individuals
only.

From a series of assumptions of this kind, the expo-
sition of the Realist doctrine of Predicables is easy. And
this, or some other of the various phases of Scholastic
Realism, must of necessity be assumed, if our intention
is to explain an old theory, not to construet a new one.

On the other hand, we have the modern Logician
expounding somewhat in the following style. Genera
and Species have no existence α parte Rei, but are
notions formed by the mind from observing certain
points of similarity in different individuals. But simi·
larity must not be confounded with identity. The image
