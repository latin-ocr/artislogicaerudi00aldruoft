CAP. IV.
De Syllogismis H ypotheticisa.

ξ. l. Syllogismus Hypotheticus‚ est in quo una,
duee, vel tres propositiones hypotheticae. v. g. Si
sapit, est beatus: Sapit ‚· ergo est beatus. Vel, Qui
sapit est beatus: Si est Philosophus, sapit ; ergo Si
est Philosophus, est beatus. Vel, Si sapit, est beatus:
Si est Philosophus, sapit; ergo Si est Philosophus,
est beatus. Nos de eo tantum loqui instituimus
qui est caeteris usitatior, in quo nempe Major
Hypothetieab.

⁸ Hypothetical syllogisms, in the present sense of the term,
are not treated of by Aristotle. An exposition of them was
first sketched out by Theophrastus, which was afterwards
further developed by Eudemus and the Stoics. None of these
works, however, have come down to us. A few notiees may
be gathered from the Greek commentators; but our principal
extant authority on the subject is Boethius. Of the συλλο-
γισμοὶ ἐξ ὑποθέσεως of Aristode, which Pacius has confounded,
and Μ. St. Hila‘u'e attempts to identify‚ with the hypotheticals
of Theophrastus, some account will be given in the Appendix,
note I. In the Proleqomena Logyica, Ι have given a theory
of hypotheticals different from that commonly adopted by
LogicianS. But that theory, though I believe it to be more
accurate than that of Aldrioh, differs too widely from his
text to be admissible here. Ι have therefore transferred it
to the Appendix, noto I.

¹³ This is the only kind of hypothetical syllogisin in which
the conclusion is catcgorical. If the minor premise, or both
promises, are hypothet'mal, the conclusion is so too. A
syllogisni with 2211 three propositions hypotheticnl was called
by 'l‘l1oopl11·ast11s‚ δι’ &mv ὑποθετικός, (Scholia, p. 179. a. 16.)
