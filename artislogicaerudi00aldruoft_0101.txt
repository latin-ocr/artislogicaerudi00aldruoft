rem per se sumptam, [ut Justz‘tz'a: Connotativmn,
quod eandem quasi alteri nexam, ut Justus]

Subjects of Inhesion. The universal substances are pre-
dicable of the singular, as genera and species of individuale.
“Socrates is a man.'' In this case the individual is a subject
of predication. Attributes are not in their original state
predicable of substances. VVhiteness exists in snow; but we
cannot say, “ Snow is whiteness.'’ Here, then, the subject is
not one of predication, but of inhesion. But, by an act of the
mind, an attribute may be so connected with a subject as to
become predicable of it as a differentia, property, or accident;
e. g. ‘⁴ snow is white.'’ Predicates thus formed from attributes
are called connotative, being said to signifyprimarzfly the attribute,
and to connote or siffnify secondarz'ly (προσσημαίνειν) the subject of
inhesion. Hence a connotative term may be defined, ‘⁴ One
which primarily signifies an attribute, secondarily a subject.”
Whereas the original universals, whether substances or at—
tributes, as “ man,'’ or “ whiteness,⁷’ were called absolute.
Again‚ by an act of the mind, the terms signifying substances‚
may be conceived in the form of attributes, so as to be no
longer predicable of the individuals; thus “ homo'' becomes
‘⁶ humanitas.'’ All such ternis, not predicable os singular
substances‚ whether primarily attributes, as ‘⁶ whiteness,'’ or
secondarily conceived as attributes, as ‘⁶ humanity‚” are called
abstract terms; all that are predicable of the individuals,
whether primarily, as ‘⁶ homo‚” or secondarily, as ‘⁶ white‚'' are
concrete. Hence the two divisions are distinct in principle,
though some of the members of each cross. For example:
Homo is concrete and absolute, albus concrete and conno-
tative, albedo abstract and absolute; but no abstract term is
connotative.

The above account differs considerably from that given by
Mr. Mill, Logic, b.'1. chap. 2. He inverts the phraseology,
describing the attribute instead of the subject as connoted,
and extends connotative terms, so as to include all concrete
general names. This is in some respects an improvement on
the scholastic distinction, but it must not be confounded with
