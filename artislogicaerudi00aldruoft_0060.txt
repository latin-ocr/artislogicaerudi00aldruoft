lvi INTRODUCTION.

the identity of Thought and Being in general, the several
identical determinations of the one and the other. Such
a process is not thought, but its negation. If the Uni-
verse had one consciousness, the system might be
possible3 for Thought and Being are identical only in
ancl through consciousness. But such universal con—
sciousness could not be my consciousness3 and thus
the Hegelian assumption cannot be grasped by any act
of human thought. On the other hand, thought without
consciousness is inconceivable; since it implies a ne-
gation of the one essentia] characteristic under which
all thought is presented to the human mind. The logical
notion which is not a function of my own persona]
thought, is a mere empty absa-action, inconceivable by
reason3 and the system deduc-ed from it is incompatible
with those regulative truths that are above reason.
Vngar Rationalism subjects belief to thought3 it has
been reserved for Transcendental Philosophy to subject
it to the annihilation of thought.

Speculative philosophy has had three great periods‚
each of which has been consummated by a critical
system of which Forma] Logic has been a constituent
portion. The Eleatic and Platonic metaphysios found
their consummation in Aristotle; the Scholastic Philo—
sophy in Occa1n3 that of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries in Kant. But from the Kantian philosophy
has arisen another phase of speculation, not less dogmatic
in its posiffions, not less extravagant in its aime, not less
unstable in its foundations. A criticism which shall sift
thoroughly the pretensions of this philosophy, it remains
for the present generation to accomplish.
