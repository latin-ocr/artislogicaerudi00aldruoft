instance given above, may we not call the fact that “ this
man envies,'' a siqu that he hates, as well as the general
statement a likelz'laood? Does not the whole distinction
depend on the question, which is the stated, which the
suppressed, premise ?

To this it may be replied, that Aristotle distinguishes
the εἰκὸς and σημεῖον merely as propositions, and no where
says that they may not be combined in the same syllogism.
In the instance given, it 80 happens that the minor premise
is a singular proposition, and may fairly be considered a
siyn of the conclusion. But we might obviously employ
a minor premise of another kind, such as, “ All malig-
nant men are envious ;'’ in which case there is, properly
speaking, no θέρη employed in the reasoning. But this
does not affect the distinction between the two Pro-
positions. A likelihood is such, per se,—a proposition
stating a general truth, which we are at liberty to apply
01· not to particular cases. A sign is a sign of something
else,—-a single fact stated as a proof of something further3
which proof may, according to material circumstances, be
logically or only morally conclusive.

Another question sometimes raised is, “If the En-
thymeine has both premises supplied, how is it to be
distinguished froin the Dialectic Syllogism ?’' To which
it may be answered, that, taking the word Syllogism in
its strictest sense, as a reasoning logically correct, the
same argument may in different points of view be con-
sidered either as a Syllogism or an Enthymeme. This
is, of course, only the case with the τεκμήριον; the other
specimens of the Enthymeme being logically invalid.
The argumentation ἐκ τεκμηρίου is in this sense both
an Enthymeme and a Syllogism3-—an Enthymeme on
material grounds, inasmuch as its premise is a siqu
of its conclusion ;—a Syllogism on formal grounds,
inasmuch as it complies with the conditions of logical
