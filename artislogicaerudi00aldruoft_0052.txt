in 1654. It contains more of Cartesianism even than the
Port Royal Logie, and is divided into four parts, Loyica
Genetioe, Loyica Analytz'ca, Hermeneutica Genetica, and
Hermeneutica Analytz‘ca. The two last parts are a series
of rules for interpreting and criticising the writings
of others. The second treats of methods of teaching,
and the qualifications for a good teacher and learner.
The first, or Logic proper, is interspersed with numerous
psychological precepts, chiefly taken from the Discours
de la Metlzode of Descartes. Many of his examples are
also taken from the Cartesian philosophy. His rules for
induction are fuller than in the old Logic, and those of
syllogism shorter.

The Port Royal Logic, or Art of Thinking, is con-
sidered as the Logic par excellence of the Cartesian
school. This work has been attributed to several
authors3 but is now generally allowed to have been
written by Arnauld, assisted by Nicole. The first
edition appeared in 166‘2. In addition to the logical
merits of this work d, the elegance and simplicity of its
style contributed iinmensely to spread and popularize
doctrines which had hitherto been reserved for the study
of the learned in the dry formulas of the schoolse. The
authors, however, must be admitted to have sacrificed
in some degree scientific accuracy to popularity3 and
in their attempt to convey miscellaneous instruction in
logical examples, they have unfortunately given their
high authority to the support of that spurious utili-
tarianism which has so often defaced the simplicity of
logical science.

Fathcr Buffier is also entitled to honourable mention
among the French Logicians. In his Principes du
