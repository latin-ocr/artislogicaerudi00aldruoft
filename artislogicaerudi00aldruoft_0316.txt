be required to prove that some A is not Β, we reason
from the assumption of the contradictory,
All A is B;
All C iS A; (συλλογισμὸς ἐξ ὑποθέσεως.)
Theref0re, All G is B.

The Conclusion being supposed to be a known false-
hood.

This mode of reasoning, as exhibited by Aristotle,
does not directly appear in the same form as the former.
For in this the hypothesis is a premise,· the conclusion
being the impossibility which has not been previously
enunciated. In the former, the premises are both new
assumptions3 the conclusion being the antecedent of
the conditional proposition which was agreed upon as
a hypothesis. Both, however, agree thus far, that the
syllogistic portion of each does not differ in form from
an ordinary Syllogism 3 and that in neither is the original
question syllogistically proved.

The notices of these Syllogisms in Aristotle are, it
must be confessed, sufficiently scanty. Thus much,
however, may fairly be gathered. Fir‘stly, that, as
regards form, they are merely the common Categorical
Syllogisms applied to a particular purpose. Secondly,
that their conclusiveness, as regards the original
question, is by way of material, not of formal conse-
quence. The syllogism by agreement obviously refers
to dialectic disputatiou, and furnishes the grounds for
a mere armamentum ad hominem, in consequence of a
previous admission. Apart from this special appli-
cation, which does not appear in the syllogism, the
proof ainounts to this:

No X is C;
All X is A ;
Thorefore, Some A is not C.
Thvreffirc, (by material consequence) Some A is not B.
