62 ARTIS LOGICAE

(cum uterque terminus distribuatur) quodvis A
differt a quovis B. Ergo vicissim: Ergo Nullum
B est A. 2. Sit vera I: Ergo falsa est ejus Con-
tradictoria E: Ergo et contradictoriae simpliciter
conversa: Ergo quae conversae contradicit, (i. e.
expositae simpliciter conversa.) est vera. 3. Sit
vera E. Ergo et ejus simpliciter conversa: Ergo
et conversae subalternata: quae est expositae con—
versa per accidens. 4. Sit vera A; Ergo et ejus
subalternata: Ergo et subalternatae simpliciter
conversa: quae est expositae per ‚Accidens‘³.

and therefore it will not be true that No A is B; which was
the original proposition. Aristotle does not assume the con-
version of I to prove that of E, which would be arguing in a
circle. For a fuller account, see Hamilton on Reid, p. (396.
Alexander himself offers a third proof by syllogism in the
first figure. No A is Β, therefore No Β is A; for suppose
“Some Β is A,” and “ No A is Β,” Some Β is not B.
Having proved the conversion of E, those of A and I will
follow from it. ‘⁴ All A is Β, therefore Some Β is A;” or else
No Β is A, and therefore (by conversion) No A is B; whereas
we assumed All A is Β. And again, Some A is Β, therefore
Some B is A; or else No B is A, and therefore No A is B.
For these proofs, the only assumption necessary is the
principle of contradiction. But proof of any kind is super-
fluous. Conversion ancl other immediate inferences are
necessary results of the laws of thought, equally evident
and more direct than the mediate inferenccs by syllogism.
Neither process is dependent on the other.
⁰ In Conversion, as in Opposition, Singular Propositions
have been neglected by Aldrich. Conccrning these, the
following extract from Wallis may assist the learncr. “ Pro-
positio Siwzgyularis, (sive Affirmativa sive Negativa‚) cum sempor
