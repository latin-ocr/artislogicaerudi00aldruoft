position simply convertible. This is requisite, in order
to comply with the condition of quatenus ipsum.

This Demonstration is exceedingly satisfactory, if we
are only allowed to assume all the conditions on which
its validity depends3 viz. 1. that risibility does flow as
an effect fmm rationality as a cause3 2. that the major
premise, in which this causation is asserted, is an
axiomatic principle, cognoscible a priori, and, as such,
carrying with its cognition, the conviction of necessity3
3. that the conclusion is not a mere repetition, in dif-
ferent words, of the major premise3 homo and animal
rationale being identica13 4. that any Demonstration
acknowledged to be valid can be resolved into the above
form.

But waiving the consideration of these questions,
which are more easily asked than answeredss, we may
find a simpler way of testing the demonstratio potissima,
by going back to the original authority. F or Aristotle’s
examples are principally taken, as is natural, from the
Mathematics3 and it is to a Geometrical theorem that the
texts of καθ’ αὑτό 3111ᾶῇ αὐτό are expressly appliedh. Can
it be believed, then, that Aristotle regarded the following
as a correct analysis of Geometrical Demonstration?

Every rectilinear figure of three sides has its angles equal
to two right angles;

Every triangle is a rectilinear figure of three sides ; therefore

Every triangle has its angles equal to two right angles.

ἕ “ Si scrupulosius inquiratur in rem hane3 Num qua sit essentialis
connexio inter rationalitatem et risibilitatem, quo sit ea propria causa hujus,
seu cansa per se; ut Rationahtas, propter ipsam sui Essentiam, non possit
esse absque Risibilitate3 neque haec absque illa: et quidem immediata,
absque interventu alifis considerationis qua connectatur; atque adaequata,
ut ad omnes rationales extendatur atque ad hos solos: subtilior forsan
esset inquisitio quam ut ei facile satisfiat.¹’ Wallis, Log. lib· 3. cap. 22.
