xxii INTRODUCTION.

the Platonic DialogueS‚ it is impossible to determine
with any accuracy how much of the doctrines and
methods advocated in those writings is due to the master,
and how much has been added by his disciple. From
the express testimony of Aristode, however, we may
conclude that Socrates did not, like Plato, maintain the
existence of ideas separate from the sensible phenomena
of the wor1cl¹⁰3 and consequently, that the exaltation of
Dialectic from its tentative use to the rank of the science
of absolute being, a view intimately connected with the
ideal theory, is due to Plato rather than to Socrates. To
Plato also probably belong in a great degree the methods
of συναγωγὴ and διαίρεσις, mentioned in the Phaedrus as the
two principal parts of Dialectic‚ and illustrated at some
length in the Sophistes and the Politicusn. The former
consists in the collection of a number of scattered
objects‚ in reference to one idea, with a view to definition;
the latter in a gradual dichotomy, by means of contrary
or contradictory members, so as to ascertain as accurately
as possible the number os subordinate species contained
under each genus. It is the careful performance of this
process, proceeding gradually through the intermediate
classes to the lowest, that especially distinguishes the
true dialectic method fron] the eristic⁰. These pro-
cesses, for which Plato was perhaps in some degree in-
debted to the Eleatic and Megaric PhilosophyP, may be

(aph. 105.) intimatos that his own inethod was perhaps anticipated by
Plato, and this hint has been ‹levoloped at greater length by Colcridge
in his Trealise nn Memmi. But tho accuracy of the parallel may be
questioned.
