NOTE G.

ΟΝ IN DUCTION.

INDUCTION, as far as it is a Logical process at all, is
equally formal with Syllogism; though proceeding in
the inverse order, viz. from the aggregate of individuals
to the universal whole constituted by them3 instead of
from the whole to the several individuals contained
under it. It is defined by Aristotle, ‘⁴ proving the major
terni of the middle by means of the minoi-³3⁷³ in which
definition, the expressions major, middle, and minor, are
used relatively to their extension, to designate respectively
the attribute proved, the constituted„ species of which it
is proved, and the aggregate of individuals by which the
species is constituted. The form in which the Inductive
Reasoningb naturally appears, exhibits an apparent,
though not a real, resemblance to the third figure of
Syllogisni. Thus:

X, Y, Z, (minen) are B (major);
X, Y, Z, are all A (middle) ; therefore,
All A is B.

The resemblance to the third figure is apparent only3
the true distinctions being, 1. That in the minor premise
of the Induction, the copula does not represent the
subject as contained under, but as coozstitutz'ny, the

predicate. ‘2s'That in consequence of this distinction,

¹· In a loose sense, Aristotle calls it ὁ ἐξ ἐπαγωγῆς συλλογισμός,
where the word does not denote the syllogism proper, οι· reasoning froin
the universal whole to the contained parts, but is extended to formal
reasoning in general. In like manner, in Rhet. ii. 25. 8. he speaks· of the
Enthymeme as including Example.
