ΟΝ THE CLASSIFICATION OF FALLACIES.

ΙΤ has been before observed¹³, that Aristotle's Treatise
περὶ σοφιστικῶν ἐλέγχων has properly only a historica]
value3 that it is important as an account of modes of
reasoning in use at the period to which it refers3 but
that it is not, and does not profess to be, a classification
based on any logical principle. Its divisions, however,
have been followed without question by the majority
of subsequent logicians, centuries after the circumstances
which gave it its chief value had ceased to exist; and
its language has become in a manner classical, though
not always restricted to the sense originally intended
by its author. Petitz'o Principii and Iynoratz'o Elenclzi
still hold their place as recognised forms of fallacy3
and the continued use of the Aristotelian nomenclature‚
at different times and under different circumstances, has
given in some respects a permanent value to that which
originally was designed only for a temporary purpose.
It is not therefore intended in the present note to pro-
pose an entirely different classification and nomenclature,
but only to point out certain principles, according to
which, if Logic is regarded as the Science of the Laws
of Thought, an arrangement of Fallacies may be at-
tempted on properly logical grounds, and some of the
deficiencies of the received enumeration supplied.

The Aristotelian list is confined to Fallacies connected
with Reasoning. But if Logic is the Science, not of the
Laws of Reasoning only, but of those of Thought in gene-
ral, it will follow that the spurious forms of Conception and
Judgment are equally entitled to a place among Logical
Fallacies. And if all the processes of Thought, so far
