points which may be considered as especially demanding
the Realist hypothesis are,

1. The admission, under any definition, of an In ma
Species.

2. The definition frequently adopted of such Species,
as being the whole essence of the individuals of which it
is predicated.

3. The assumption that every such Species has one
absolute differentia, convertible with‘ the Species, and
serving to distinguish it from every other.

It is not asserted that these views were held by none
but professed Realists. The first, indeed, may be traeed
to Aristotle, who has by different writers been regarded
as a Realist, a Conceptualist, and a Nominalist, in the
strictest senseb3 it is also to be found in Porphyry, who
in the commencement of his treatise proclaims himself
neutral: and it was subsequently adopted by the scholastic
Nominalists⁰. The second is held by Boethius, who, as

in the schools till the time of Aquinas, was afterwards
adopted by Nominalists and Realists indifferently ⁹. But

Hispanus3 though sometimes with the saving clause, that it must be
understood with reference to the Stoical notions of the Gods. Aquinas
was the first who expelled the Genus aw'mal rationale from the Arbor
Porphyriana, and, limiting rationality to men, distinguished Angels as
intellectuales. Os. Summa, P. i. Qu. lviii. 3. Opusc. xlviii. Traet. 1. cap. 4.
