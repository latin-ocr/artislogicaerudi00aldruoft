xlii INTRO'DUCTION.

name among the Schoolmen: the triumph of Nominalism
involved the downfall of the principa] applications of
the scholastic method. Buridan, his disciple, the reputed
author of the sophism called Asinus BuridaniP, deve-
loped the doctrines of Nominalism to a still further
extent, but has the character of having pushed to an
extreme point the subtleties distinctive of the scho-
lastic system. Another philosopher of the same period,
Walter Burley, is the author of some commentaries on
the Logic and Physics of Aristotle, and deserves mention
as the author of an attempt to extend the narrow his-
torica] knowledge of the period by a work entitled
de vita et moribus philosophorum et poetarum. This
work, of which the philosophica] portion extends from
Thales to Seneca, is in part compiled from Laertius,
whose work the author seems to have possessed in a
more complete form than that which is now extantq.
In itself however it is of small value and contains many
errorsr.

The reaction against the Scholastic Logic began in
the fifteenth century. Laurentius Valla, Rodolphus
Agricola, and Ludovicus Vives, successively attacked
the system in 1440, 15165, and 1531. Their attacks
were directed, partly against the Latinity, partly against
the matter of the School Logic. The additions proposed

by these reformers are chiefly rhetorical innovations
from Cicero and Quintilian.

have held a middle course between Noniinalisn] and Realism. See
Hauremi, vol. ii. p. 1176. Brucker classes him with the nominalists,
Tennemann with thc realists.

a posthumous work, first publislled 111 an imperfect form at Louvain 111
