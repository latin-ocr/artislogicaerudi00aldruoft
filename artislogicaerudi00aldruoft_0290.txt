clusion ¹¹¹, but whether such premises can properly be said
to be beyqed, or assumedss. It is clear then that Petitz'o
Principii is not the fault with which the Syllogism is
chargeable, unless it can be shewn that every statement
of an Universal Proposition must be, in this sense of the
term, beyyz‘ny or assuminq. If there are any cases in
which the assertion of such propositions depends on
a warranted conviction, not on a gratuitous assumption,
from whatever source that conviction may arise, such
cases must be exempt from the charge of Petitio
Principii.

And if there be any such cases, the opponents of the
Syllogism have themselves unwittingly stumbled upon
a fallacy cognate to that with which they taunt its

m One class of reasonings are perhaps fairly chargeable with the fallacy.
I allude to what are commonly called the proper sylloyisms of the Ramists,
which have two Singular Premises. In the first figure, it is evident that
the conclusion is not one out of many inserences contained in the major
premise, but the very same proposition stated in different language. The
third figure is open to the same objection, but it may be allowed as an
ἔκθεσις or expository instance—a process not reckoned by Aristotle as
syllogistic. Proper syllogisms in the second figure are valid, and frequently
serviceable; but when reduced to the first, (which Aristotle regards as a ι
necessary test of validity,) the negative premise must be converted from
singular to universal.

Nevertheless, as the Petitio Principii is a material, not a logical, fallacy,
this does not surnish grounds for objecting to the convenient arrangement
by which singular propositions are considered as in syllogism equivalent.
to universals. They may be regarded, in common with other cases of the

same fall-acy, as reasonings valid in form, but unsound from material
circumstances.

The Proper Syllogisms, however, though a post-Aristotelian innovation,
did not originate with Rainus. Aquinas expressly denies that both premises
in a syllogism may be singular, and admits the ἔκθεσις as a non-syllogistic
process, being an appeal to the senses, not to the reason. See Opusc. xlvii.
init. Occam, on the other hand, virtually surrenders the whole principle,
when he allows that the major premise in the first figure may be singular. Α
