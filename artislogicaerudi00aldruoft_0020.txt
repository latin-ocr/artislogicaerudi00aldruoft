to the colloquial form, which, whether in solitary medi—
tation, or in conversation with others, Plato regarded as
the true method of eliciting and communicating know-

Dialectic, if used solely in conformity with Aristotle’s
authority, would correspond, not to the Organon as a
whole, but only to the two last treatises, the Topics and
Sophistic Refutations0.

Thus much may suffice, as regards the origin and use
of the name Logic and the cognate terins. More ini-
portantis the inquiry, to what extent the science itself,
as exhibited in Aristotle, is indebted to the labours of
previous philosophers. Dialectic, the thing though pro-
bably not the name, is regarded, on the authority of
Aristotle, as the invention of Zeno the Eleatiop. By this
is probably only meant that Zeno was the first to employ
