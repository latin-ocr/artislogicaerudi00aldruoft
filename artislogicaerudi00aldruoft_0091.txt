Apprehensioni‚ Indis-tinctio ‚· Judicio‚ Falsitas;
Discursui, Mendosa Collectio. Quae cum Sapi-
entes animadverterent, et opportuna illis remedia

by Burgersdyck Inst. Loq. 1. ii. c. l. “Mens nostra qua-
druplici defectu laborat, cum occupata est in investiganda
rerum cognitione: vel enim non assequitur propositae rei
essentiam, sed circa illius accidentia solum haeret ac sensi-
biles notas; vel essentiam rei confuse tantum concipit, et
ratione minime distincta; vel in dubiis non reperit quid
statuat, aut etiam statuit quod falsum est; vel denique non
servat ordinem iu commentando, qui cum natura rerum
consentit. Hisce quatuor malis opponit Logica totidem
remedia. Definitio exhibet menti essentiam rerum: divisio
efficit cognitionem distinctam: syllogismus tollit animi
incertitudinem et errorem circa themata complexa: methodus
ἀταξίαν sive confusionem.'’ Hence it appears that falsity of
judgment simply was not regarded as remediable by Logic,
but only falsity in relation to the syllogism, i. e. so far as it
depends on the assumed truth or falsity of other judgments.
But the above statement requires considerable limitation.
Every process of thought is liable to a formal defect, as
violating its own laws, and to a material defect, as inconsistent
with experience. Thus a concept may be obscure or indis-
tinct formally, as implying attributes which cannot be thought
in conjunction, as when its different parts contradict one
another: a judgment may be formally false, for the same
reason: and a reasoning may be formally inconsequent‚ as
transgressing the laws of the syllogism. In all these cases
the fault may be detected by Logic. On the other hand, a
concept may be materially obscure or indistinct‚ as containing
attributes which we have never met with in our own expe-
rience: a judgment may be materially false, as being at
varlance with facts :— a reasoning may be materially incon-
sequent, as not warranted by the laws or analogies of nature.
In all these cases, the fault can only be detected and reme-

died by experience. Of. Prolesyomena, Loyica, p. 238, (and ed.
p. 257.)
