data, so he is competent to examine all that is or pro-
fesses to be formed in like manner from like data. To
distinguish the apparent from the real is the purpose
of logical critioismb: that which presents no false ap-
pearance is beyond its field. If a thought professes to
be based solely on formal grounds, to be guaranteed
as legitimate by the laws of thought alone, Logic is
competent to examine and decide upon its pretensions.
If it professes to rest in any degree on extralogical
foundations, on a sensible experience for example, or on
suppressed premises, Logic neither accepts nor rejects
its claims to a material validity, but dismisses it to be
tried before another tribunal. Accordingly when Logic
is defined to be the science of the laws of formal thinking,
or the science of the laws of thought as thought, (not as
modified by experience,) it follows that it can adequately
determine the conceivability of an object, the truth or
falsehood of an analytical judgment, or the validity of
a professedly formal reasonin g, in which the given premises
are stated as the complete conditions of the conclusion.
On the other hand, it cannot determine the real eoeistenee
of an object, the truth or falseliood of a Syntheticaljudg-
ment, or the validity of a reasoning professedly material,
in which the premises are given as a part only of the
conditions of the conclusion. Forma] thinking can be
called into operation by itself. Materia] thinking can
only operate in conjunction with an act of perception or
memory3 and the laws of thought alone are no guarantee
for the trust-worthiness of the concomitant process. It
is of course open to any innovator to attempt to extend
the boundaries of the science by material additions3 but
