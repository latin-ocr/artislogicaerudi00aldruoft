⁰ With the following account of the Fallacies may be com-

pared the corresponding chapter in the Rhetoric, ii. 24. In
doing so, however, it must be remembered, that the present
sophisms occur in a disputation carried on in colloquial form
between antagonists, and conforming to established rules;
whereas those are introduced ad libitum by an Orator in the
course of his speech, Hence, though the principle of deception
may be similar, the manner of its application will not always
correspond. The same cantion is still more necessary in
examining modern specimens of Sophistry.

d This Fallacy, as treated by Aristode, includes a wrong
composition of clauses in a sentence capable of two punc-
tuations. In this extension, the exainples possibile est se-
dentem stare, cte. are easily included under Composition; the
sense varying according as sedentem is joined with possibile est,
or with stare. The Fallacy os Division, in like manner, will
include the separation os clauses which ought to be united.
