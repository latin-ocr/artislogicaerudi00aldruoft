RomMENTA. 39

ram quoque dicitur) Definitio ,· cujus est, assignare
conceptus et voces, quibus ea, quae ab invicem
distincta volumus, velut agrorum fines, ex limitibus

suis dignoscantur. Quae cum definitis notiora esse
debeant magisque obvia, Definitio vulgo dicitur
Oratio explicativa definiti. Oratio (inquam) ut aT0p.1.5.1.
nomine distinguatur3 Explicativcz quoque, nam et
nomen exprimit.

Definitio alia, Nominalis est, quae vocis signifi-ff-Jgst·

cationem aperit; alia, Realz's, quae rein naturam.

¹² Rei, i. e. of an universal notion existing in the mind; with-
out entering on the question whether there exists any external
universal nature corresponding to it. Since all such notions
are represented by words, a real, or more correctly speaking
a notiomael, definition, will at the same time unfold the meaning
of the word by which the given notion is represented. Still
the two kinds of definition must not be confounded. A real
definition has primarily for its object to analyse a complex
notion into its component parts. Words are employed
secondarz'ly, though unavoidably. as signs, both of the whole
notion, and of the simpler notions of which it is composed.
But the object of nominal definition is to determine of what
notion, simple or complex, a given word is the sign. The
notion may be already known, more 01· less clearly, by means
of other signs, though we were not aware of its connexion
with the word in question. A different distinction between ’
nominal and real definition is given by Leibnitz, Noaveauoe
Essais, l. iii. c. 3.

If this account of real definition is correct, it will follow
that the same notion admits of only one definition; since
the same notion cannot be a combination of more than one
group of attributes. And nothing can be more clear than
Aristotle's testimony on these points, nothing more positive
than his repudiation of the so-called ‹weidental and physical
definitions. (Cf. Top. vi. 4, 2. vi. 14, 5. i. 8. 2, 3. Metaph. vi.
