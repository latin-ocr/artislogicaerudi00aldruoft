The first of these is his method of investigating, or,
as he terins it, lmntz'ny for, the Definition. This may be
effected in two ways, commonly called the methods of
Division and Induction. The first of these consists in
taking a wide Genus, under which the object to be defined
is evidently included, and contracting it by the addition
of successive differentiae, till we obtain a complex notion
coextensive with that of thch the Definition is sought.
Of the notion thus obtained, each separate part is more
extensive than that which is to be defined, though the
whole is not sog. A good example of this method is
given by Cicero: ‘⁴ Sic igitur veteres praecipiunt: cum
sumseris ea, quae sint ei rei, quam definire velis, cum
aliis communia, usque eo persequi, dum proprium
efficiatur, quod nullam in aliam rem transferri possit.
Ut hoc, Hereditas est pecunia. Commune adhuc:
multa enim genera sunt pecuniae. Adde quod sequitur:
quae morte alicujus ad quempiam pervenit. Nondum
est definitio: multis enim modis sine hereditate teneri
mortuorum pecuniae possunt. Unum adde verbum,jure:
jam a communitate res disjuncta videbitur, ut sit ex-
plicata definitio sic: Hereditas est pecunia, quae morte
alicujus ad quempiam pervenit jure. Nondum est satis3
adde, nec ea ant legata testamentO, aut possessione

retenta: confectum esth.''

ἕ Anal. Post. ii. 13. 3. Τὰ δὴ τοιαῦτα ληπτέον μέχρι τούτου, ἕως τοσαῦτα
ληφθῇ πρῶτον, ὧν ἕκαστον μὲν ἐπὶ πλεῖον ὑπάρξει, ἅπαντα δὲ μὴ ἐπὶ πλέον·
ταύτην γὰρ ἀνάγκη οὐσίαν εἶναι τοῦ πράγματος. Yet in the Metaphysics
(vi. 12.) he seems to maintain that the last differentia must be co-
extensive with the subject; a view generally adopted by the Scholastic
Logicians, though manifestly inconsistent, not only with the passage above
quoted, but with the example appended, τὸ δὲ τελευταῖον καὶ τῇ δυάδι. 111
the Metaphysics however he seems to be speaking, not of the specific
difference per se, but of the difference regarded as dividing the genus.
But this is in fact equivalent only to saying that the whole must be co-
extensive3 which no one would think of denying.
