rience3 but if Q contains the attributes Ο, Ρ, Ι can by
a law of thought alone determine that all Q is P, oris
Q contain an attribute contradictory of Ρ, Ι can in like
manner determine that no Q is P. The Laws of Identity
and Contradiction are here again called into operation.
Hence as a general rule: all analytical jndging is formal:
all synthetical judging is material.

Forma] reasoning is possible when the given judgments
are connected by a middle term under such conditions
of quantity and quality that the mere act of thought
necessarily elicits the conclusion. If any addition to
the data is required, the consequence is material.
Purely formal mediate reasoning or syllogisxn is de-
pendent on the same laws as formal judging‚ the Law
of Identity governing the affirmative categorica] syllo-
gism and the Law of Contradiction the negative²; while
the subordinate Law of Excluded Middle is called into
operation in the immediate inferences of Opposition
and Conversi01]². A single example must suffice. In
a syllogism in Barbara we reason in this form. ⁷“ All
A is [some] B, all C is [some] A, therefore all C is
[some] B.” The law which determines the conclusion
is, that whatever is identical with a portion of A is
identical with a portion of that which is identical with
all A. Here is again the Principle of Identity. “Every
portion of a concept is identical with itself.” The
other forins of syllogisn] may easily be analysed in the
same manner.

The critical province os Logic is coextensive with the
constructive. As the logician can form conceptS,judg·
ments, reasonings, in a certain manner from certain

Z Hypothetical and Disjuiictivejudgments and reasonings are omitted,
