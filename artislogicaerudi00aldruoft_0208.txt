CAP. VI.
De Metlzodo ³.

ξ. l. METHODUS est talis dispositio partium
alicujus disciplinae, ut integra facilius discaturb.

ὃ Μέθοδος in Aristotle is employed with various shades of
meaning; l. for any instrument of acquiring or communicating
knowledge3 aS in de An, i. l. 4. πότερον ἀπόδειξίς τίς ἐστιν ἢ διαί-
ρεσιςῆ καί τις· ἄλλη μέθοδος. Cf. Philoponus, Scholia, p. 235, a. 10.
2. for knowledge reduced to system ; and thus as equivalent
to ἐπιστήμη; Phys. Auso. i. 1. 1. Eth. Nic. i. 1. l. Top. i. 2. 2.
3. for a systematic treatise on any branch of knowledge,
synonymous with πραγματείας Polit. iv. 2. l. vi. 2. 6. Eth. Nic.
i. 2. 9. But Method, in the present sense of arrangement, is
not treated 'of in the logical writings of Aristot]e‚ with the
exception of a few rules for the arrangement (τάξις) of a dialec-
tical disputation in the eighth book of the Topics. A lost
treatise‚ called Mefflwhw, is mentioned in the Rhetoric, I. 2.
Method‚ as a distinct part of Logic, was first introduced by
Ramns, and from him passed to the logical writings of the
Cartesians and of Gassendi, by whom it was treated as a
fourth part of Logic. Like most of the additions to the
Aristotelian system, it was originally the property of the
Rhetoricians.

b Method has been treated of by Logicians in two principal
senses. l. As a process of inference from the known to the
unknown; which is the earlier sense of the term, and sanc-
tioned by Aristotle and his Greek interpretors. 22. As an
arrangement of truths already known, with a view of com-
municating thom to others, The last corresponds to the
Greek τάξις, and should rather be called Ordo. It is distin-
guished from the first by Zabarella and others. Aldrich's
‹rlefinition corresponds only to the second sense of Methodus:
bnt in his suhsequent division he eonsounds it, with the first.
