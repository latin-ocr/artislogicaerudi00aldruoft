applied to another. Thus far Mr. Mill's position is
unquestionably true3 but Ι think it may be shewn to be
not itself the fundamental assumption of Geometry‚ but
a consequence derivable from a higher assumption.

The existence is clearly only that which is implied in
the possible construction of the figure. The actual or
possible existence in nature of a body so figured is not
once appealed to in the demonstiation, and might be
denied without affeeting its validity. The Postulate,
therefore, implies the possible construction of a figure,
such as is contemplated in the proposition.

But this construction is mental, not manual. The
figure as drawn upon paper is only a representative of
the figure as imagined by the mind, and might be dis-
pensed with altogether if the latter could be kept before
us with sufficient steadiness. This brings us to Kant's
principle of the possibility of mathematica] science, viz.
the power of constructio& the objects of its concepts;
i. e. of presenting them α priori in a pure intuition.

But how is this construction itself possible, and what
conditions is it required to fulfil? Mr. Mill regards it
as only possible a posteriori, and as subject to the same
conditions as an object of sense. He says, “ the points,
lines, eircles, and squares, which any one has in his
mind, are simply copies of the points, lines, circles‚ and
squares which he has known in his experience. We
can reason about a line as if it had no breadth3 but we
cannot conceive a line without b1·ea(lth‘¹.” This is true3
but the author is mistaken in supposing such a con-
ception to be necessary to establish the a priori character
of Mathematics. The true Postulate is not that of the
possible existence of au object corresponding to the
definition, but of one fulfilling the conditions of the
proper axiom. We are not required to conceive a
